Luker is a next-generation roleplay chat platform.

- Early story details are quoted accurately when a reply calls for them
- Multiple agents explore the context and draft the message body
- Edit character cards by talking to the AI, with diffs approved item by item
- Look up fan material and source lore on the web mid-roleplay

## What is Luker

Luker is a purpose-built environment for roleplay with large language models. It ships a graph-based long-term memory, a multi-agent scene planner with a reusable skill library, an AI-assisted character-card studio, a preset assistant, native LAN sync, and a real Android app that runs the whole backend on your phone — all in one install, no third-party extensions required.

Luker is built on [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) and stays **100% data-compatible** with it. Character cards, world info, presets, and chats move both ways with zero migration cost.

## Highlights

### Memory Graph — your characters actually remember

A knowledge-graph long-term memory. Chat content distills into typed nodes (characters, locations, events, plotlines) with links between them. Before a reply, a recall pass walks the graph and injects the most relevant memories — so when the protagonist returns to a place they visited earlier, an early character who has long been off-stage is recalled.

### Multi-Agent Orchestrator — multiple agents explore the context and draft the message body

A configurable team of agents runs first and hands off to the writer LLM: distiller condenses recent context, planner sketches the next scene, critic reviews. The final reply arrives with a runtime trace you can inspect. Choose from the execution modes — Spec (a fixed pipeline), Single Agent, Agenda (the flow dispatches agents dynamically), Loop (a single agent iterates on tool calls until the task is complete), or Director (a main agent and a sub-agent team explore the context and draft the message body).

### Skills — reusable knowledge packs, loaded on demand

Reusable knowledge packs an agent reads on demand: writing rules, voice conventions, anti-cliché checklists. The format is compatible with Anthropic's Claude Skills. The orchestrator's default Director profile ships with bundled skills, and skills can be distributed with a character card or a preset.

→ [Skills documentation](https://luker.cups.moe/features/skills/)

### CardApp Studio & AI Card Editor — edit cards by talking to an AI

A full IDE for character cards with a CodeMirror-6 editor, an AI chat panel, and diff-based approval of changes, item by item. Regular cards get the popup editor; cards with an embedded **CardApp** — a card-hosted mini-application — open in the full Studio with file tree, live preview, and history.

### Preset Assistant — build a preset from a description

Tell the assistant what you want a chat-completion preset to do. It iterates on the preset with you, presenting changes as diffs for review, until it matches — reading parameters, editing prompt entries, and comparing against a reference preset. The same workflow covers orchestrator presets.

→ [Preset Assistant documentation](https://luker.cups.moe/features/preset-assistant)

### Native Android APK — the full platform on your phone

The Luker backend runs *inside* an Android app. Install the APK, open it, and you get the full server plus UI on a single device — no Termux, no manual Node install, no port forwarding. Backup ZIP import in the first-run screen makes migration painless.

→ [Android app guide](https://luker.cups.moe/guide/android)

### Search Tools — characters can search the web

Give the writer LLM a live web-search tool (DuckDuckGo, SearXNG, Brave), or run a pre-request search agent that writes results into world info before the reply starts. Backed by real search engines, not just a training-data lookup.

→ [Search Tools documentation](https://luker.cups.moe/features/search-tools)

### LAN Sync

Pair two Luker instances on the same network. Chats, cards, world info, and settings sync between them, so your desktop and your phone stay in step without pushing anything to a cloud.

→ [LAN Sync guide](https://luker.cups.moe/improvements/lan-sync)

### Chat merge & split

Split a long chat at any turn or merge chats; branch history stays consistent. Useful when a scene got out of hand and you want to fork off the interesting parts without losing the rest.

→ [Chat management](https://luker.cups.moe/basics/chat-management)

### TTS NPC dialogue attribution

With TTS enabled, quoted lines in a reply can play with their own speaker's voice. A background pass works out who says which quote — NPCs it discovers appear in the voice map automatically, and names you add in advance are recognized from the first playback.

→ [TTS NPC dialogue attribution](https://luker.cups.moe/features/tts-npc-attribution)

### Change the model, keep your prompt setup

In SillyTavern, API connections and chat-completion presets move together, so switching to a different model drags your prompt configuration along with it. Luker decouples the two: swap the model without rebuilding your prompt setup, swap the preset without touching your API keys.

### Close the tab — the reply keeps writing

Generation runs on the backend, streamed to the UI over WebSocket. Reload the tab, close the laptop lid, lose Wi-Fi — the reply keeps writing on the server and reconnects to your UI the moment you're back. Nothing is lost, nothing has to restart.

→ [Backend storage & lifecycle](https://luker.cups.moe/improvements/backend-storage)

---

A long tail of smaller conveniences rounds it out — grouping for presets and prompts, per-chat persona locks, undo toasts, a trace of which World Info entries fired and why, model lists fetched live from each provider. All of them are documented on the [docs site](https://luker.cups.moe).

## From SillyTavern?

Luker is 100% data-compatible with SillyTavern in both directions. Copy your `data/` folder over and you're done — cards, world info, presets, chats, personas, settings. Global third-party extensions are stored outside `data/`, in `public/scripts/extensions/third-party/`, so copy them separately. If you decide to go back, copy it in the other direction; Luker-exclusive data (memory graphs, orchestrator configs) sits in separate state files that SillyTavern ignores. **Back up before you migrate anyway.**
