# Changelog

This changelog covers every Luker release, from v1.0.0 to the current development version.

## v2.8.0 (2026-10-01)

### Multi-Agent Orchestrator

- **Added two built-in director presets**: Default (Memory Graph + Search) and Default (No Memory Graph, No Search).
- Agent preset pickers can import the bundled agent presets in one click.
- **Skills can now be bound to orchestration presets**, and the binding survives renames, deletions, and exports.
- Skill tools are available only to orchestration agents, not the main chat.
- **Custom tools can now be authored and test-run inside the iteration studio.**
- The orchestration preset dropdown can directly select global or per-character agent presets.
- Each preset can define a world info filter that applies wherever agents read the book.
- Loop, spec, and agenda agents can force-activate dormant lorebook entries.
- Runtime agents gain world book browsing tools to list visible books and inspect entry indexes and contents.
- Spec and agenda agents now read Open Notes.
- User regex now applies to what agents read and what they output.
- Raised agent round limits and removed hidden upper bounds from configurable settings.
- Reworked the orchestrator settings drawer into Agents, Tools & Skills, and General tabs, and all changes save automatically.
- The run panel shows per-agent timers.
- Finished rounds collapse automatically when a run ends.
- Improved the simulation review experience.
- Concurrent sub-agent dispatches wait for the first streamed chunk to reuse the upstream prompt cache.
- Spec preset cards show which nodes bind them.
- Draft editing is now a per-agent tool permission, enabled on the main agent by default.
- Switching the director preset no longer overwrites the user's chat completion preset files.
- Deleting a chat completion preset clears references to it from orchestration presets.
- Custom tools embedded in an imported character card are reviewed before they are registered.
- Editing spec and agenda presets now keeps tools, skills, and default-tool state.
- The Open Notes panel refreshes as agents write and reports failed writes.
- The running indicator no longer covers the toolbar.
- Stopping a run now halts immediately instead of waiting for the current round to end.
- Fixed stale preset selections after creating or renaming presets; sub-agents deleted from a character card are no longer brought back by the global config.

### Memory Graph

- **Added a graph revision studio** where the AI proposes changes as reviewable diff cards with rollback.
- **Added thread nodes** that track long-running plotlines.
- Extraction gains a crawl mode: it first explores the graph structure and starts from a rough outline, saving prompt tokens.
- Simplified recall to LLM and RAG modes, with optional rerank and query rewrite.
- Recall is now balanced across node types, so one dominant type no longer crowds out the rest.
- **Added a recency horizon for always-injected nodes**; nodes beyond it fall back to normal recall.
- Setting the recall query window to zero now uses only the last user message.
- Removed the length cap on RAG recall queries.
- Event extraction now separates what a character lived through from a mere mention, and merges symmetric relations into a single edge.
- Event extraction scales detail with hierarchy depth and classifies psychological state and NPC baselines.
- Graph editor saves and compressions anchor at the floor they actually cover; a failed batch edit no longer applies the rest of its batch.
- Vector search returns concrete events only, without rollup summaries.
- User regex now applies to the text extraction reads.
- Reorganized the settings drawer into Recall, Extract, Graph, and Advanced tabs, with field help throughout.
- Fixed empty replays wiping the graph, stale vectors leaking after a chat reset, and read failures going unreported; deleted event summaries no longer leak into the world info scan.
- Swipe regenerations reuse the recall snapshot from the same turn.
- Swiping the opening greeting no longer invalidates the memory graph.

### Character Card Editor (CardApp Studio)

- Fixed a batch of card-editing reliability issues: applied edits no longer roll back on their own, the rollback button works again, and duplicate diff cards are gone.
- Replacing a character card now offers world book choices: import the new card's embedded book, keep the previous book, or merge the two in the editor.

### Iteration Studio

- **Sessions in all four studios now persist and replay tool calls and results across reloads.**
- **Tool calls render as diffs**, and message cards show the assistant's thinking.
- **Regenerating a step now undoes its already-applied edits first**, and every user message gains an Edit button.
- The AI now reads only the fields it needs instead of reading everything up front, and failed edits come back with a clear diagnosis.
- Failed tool calls now return the real error and reason instead of silently doing nothing.
- Session histories moved to per-character storage, and closing a popup flushes pending changes immediately.

### Presets & Prompt Manager

- **A card can now bind multiple chat completion presets**, with a default and a clear-all control.
- **Prompts can attach to an existing message** instead of only relative positions.
- Preset-scoped world info now survives export and import.
- Prompt entries can be dragged into existing groups, and sub-group rendering is fixed.

- **Each connection profile can now set its own request timeout and retry policy.**
- **Connection profiles can now auto-continue when a response is truncated**, with a configurable attempt limit.
- **Added an OpenAI Responses chat completion source.**
- **Custom models are now saved per connection profile**, so switching profiles no longer mixes them.
- Kimi gains partial prefill and correct reasoning forwarding.
- Added support for the newer Claude 5 and Opus 4 models, and dropped obsolete beta flags that blocked Bedrock.
- Advanced request settings fold into a collapsible drawer.
- Google AI Studio now retries when a request is blocked by safety filters instead of failing, and Vertex model listing is fixed.
- OpenRouter adds a Gemini history cache, with a configurable number of recent turns left uncached.
- The Custom source now forwards reasoning effort and omits the parameter when set to Auto.
- The connection manager warns when Claude prompt caching is combined with squashing post-processing.
- Fixed the model picker selecting a wrong model.
- Fixed profile switching overwriting the model field.
- Fixed "Save and Update" skipping the profile write when the exclude list was unchanged, which dropped additional parameters.
- Fixed /model with no argument not reading the input box.

### Generation & Streaming

- **Unified the generation pipeline for chat completions, text completions, NovelAI, Kobold, and image generation**, fixing generation under Bun.
- **Claude, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter thinking content now persists and replays across turns.**
- Stop requests reach providers immediately, so a ComfyUI image job can be interrupted mid-run.
- Token counting and token encoding are configured independently.
- Recovered generations reconnect to the live stream.
- Token counting moved off the main thread so long prompts no longer freeze the UI, and more tokenizers are bundled locally.
- Upstream errors now arrive as proper error responses instead of hanging streams, and error text is no longer truncated mid-message.
- Empty responses are retried automatically.
- Hiding a message now hides its tool call records as well.
- Unknown models fall back to client-side tiktoken tokenization.

- Card replacement now shows a structured full-screen diff overview.
- **Chats can be merged in a chosen order or split at chosen points.**
- Streaming token usage is displayed and normalized across providers.
- Chat search now covers older messages that are not loaded yet.

- Opening a recent chat no longer creates a phantom empty chat file.
- The Manage chat files popup highlights the currently open chat.
- Replacing a card with the same file again now works after a failed replacement.
- New group chats no longer hit a save conflict on the first message.
- First-run onboarding no longer blocks characters and group chats from loading.

### World Info

- **Reworked mobile World Info editing** with a cleaner layout that survives viewport switches.
- Lorebooks embedded in a card stay bound across reloads, and deleted entries stop leaking into exports.
- World books with array-form entries import and edit correctly.
- Exporting a card whose bound world book cannot be embedded now shows a warning.
- Deleting a missing world book no longer errors.

### Request Inspector

- **Request and response views now display reasoning content, thinking blocks, and signatures.**
- The upstream native finish reason is displayed alongside the normalized one.

- **The Backup Manager now converts backups between storage modes.**
- Added a storage inspector with subdirectory browsing.
- Restore archives upload in chunks with retry and resume.
- **Added LAN Sync**: two Luker instances on the same network can pair, sync incrementally by category, resolve conflicts file by file, and undo the last sync.
- LAN Sync saves peer credentials and warns when a pairing link belongs to a different account.
- Migrations between file-system and database backends preserve chat integrity and timestamps.
- Deleting a chat or character now offers to delete associated media as well; character asset folders are deleted with the card.
- Unsafe file names are now rejected before being written to storage.
- The Backup Manager groups its data-category selection into its own section that applies to download, restore, and migration links.

### TTS

## v2.7.0 (2026-06-13)

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Added preset libraries — each mode (spec / agenda / loop / director) can hold multiple presets across global and per-character scopes, and legacy single-slot config migrates into the default preset on first open.
- Added a run panel that slides in beside the chat (or up from the bottom on mobile) the moment a run starts, streams reasoning, text, tool calls, and sub-agent activity in real time, can be reopened from a floating pill after dismissal, and shows accumulated token totals in the header.
- Retired the old runtime-trace popup — the run panel takes over everywhere.
- Sub-agents can now use regex to precisely locate matches and get line-level output across chat history, world-info entries, SKILL files, and the director's in-progress draft.
- Iteration studio in the global scope can now read and write world info.
- The completion-preset assistant's orchestrator-adaptation mode now performs a structural sanity check that flags agent-identity content, SKILL references, and jailbreak response-shape verbs landing on the wrong layer.
- Fixed the director-mode stop button so clicking it halts between tools and during sub-agent waits instead of waiting for round boundaries; a fast stop followed by regenerate no longer starts two agents writing to the same slot.
- Improved text-selection marker performance in the simulation popup.
- Fixed the Clear Character Override and Reset to Defaults buttons.

### Character Editor Assistant

- Unless the user explicitly names them, the AI no longer writes into the scenario, system prompt, or post-history instructions fields — content is steered into world info instead.

### Iteration Studio

- Diff cards for individual changes now render consistently across every popup.
- Brighter palette closer to GitHub's.
- Improved iteration studio prompts.

### Memory Graph

- Memory Graph commits are now correctly anchored at the operation's trigger floor.

### Performance

- Long-prompt token counting no longer blocks the UI.
- Improved chat-view and prompt-manager performance.
- Made the startup version check non-blocking so a slow network can't freeze startup (thanks to @1362278443 for the PR).

### Fixes

- The one-click debug export bundle now ships the full request-inspector history.
- Floor state no longer gets stuck on a broken history log — the broken floor and its sibling commits are truncated, the bad portion is archived as an orphan log, and earlier floor state is preserved intact.
- Fixed the world-info drawer resetting after toggling entries.
- Fixed the Claude backend prompt cache when system content is merged into the first user message by post-processing.
- If the uploads directory is deleted after startup, uploads no longer fail permanently; the directory is recreated when needed.

### Default SKILL

- Anti-cliché SKILL adds a new numeral + classifier ban.

### Documentation

- Added agent preset documentation.
- Added documentation on authoring custom orchestration tools.
- Added a recipe "Customize per-card orchestration" walking through three actions — generate a card-specific orchestration from one sentence, use simulation and annotation to mark clichés and unexpected output so the studio can refine the orchestration, and have the AI write a custom tool that validates output format.

### New Contributors

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/funnycups/Luker/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1

## v2.6.0 (2026-06-07)

### Highlights

- Added a new Skill subsystem: capture reusable writing methods, character voices, anti-trope rules, and curation playbooks as SKILL.md files, save them per global / character / preset scope, mount them per sub-agent as chips inside the orchestrator, and have the runtime inject the matched skill directory into the agent's context; ships with 21 bundled Chinese-language creation skills (character voice, story brainstorming, anti-trope, memory curation, and more), can be authored interactively from the iteration studio or the completion-preset assistant dialog, and is included when characters or presets are exported and imported.
- Added a custom-tools system for the orchestrator: register your own tools for the AI to call across all four modes (Agenda, Spec, Director, Loop), with the built-in memory, web search, and preset management exposed as opt-in tools, per-agent override panels for selecting which tools are enabled, and an inline review flow for tools embedded in imported character cards.
- Added a simulation review popup: clicking "simulate" in the orchestrator or in the character / preset assistants now actually runs a real quiet generation and shows the full agent chain, the final output, and the world-info entries that fired; you can highlight text to add inline annotations, re-run with one click, and the annotations flow back into the studio AI as guidance for the next iteration. Write tools are sandboxed during simulation so nothing leaks into real data.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Added lorebook write tools inside the iteration studio: the AI can disable or rewrite world-info entries on the active character, every change lands as a diff card you approve or reject one by one, and only the approved set is committed when you press Apply.
- Added a per-sub-agent cap on tool-call rounds in Director mode: critic-style sub-agents can stay tight at one or two rounds while memory-scout-style sub-agents get a wider budget.
- Added an enable / disable toggle next to each mode's character-override config, so you can temporarily fall back to the global config without deleting the whole override.
- Extended the reasoning trace to Spec, Agenda, and Loop modes, so Claude thinking, OpenAI o1, and similar reasoning content now show up there too.
- Runtime trace now pairs each tool call with its result inline under args / result / error labels instead of scattering them across the timeline.
- Hardened sub-agent identity framing: sub-agent prompts are reshuffled into a four-section meta frame so they stop drifting into "let me continue the scene as the character" because of trailing role directives.
- Fixed character-override config in Director mode silently appearing not to save.
- Fixed sub-agents not seeing the in-flight draft on round one, which caused critics to give feedback against the wrong revision.
- Fixed memory-graph write rejections being swallowed: the AI now sees the actual failure reason instead of retrying forever.
- Fixed memory entries extracted from a deleted message lingering and being re-injected after a regenerate.
- Fixed the orchestrator not forwarding the in-flight floor when writing to memory-graph, which caused commits to land on empty placeholders.

### Character / preset assistants (CEA / CPA)

- The preset assistant's "orchestrator optimize" pass now moves rewritten guidance entries before the Chat History prompt by default, leaving only the jailbreak / unlock-style ones at the tail.
- Refined the preset assistant's guidance on managing prompt order inside presets, giving the AI better control over RP output shaping when revising a preset.
- Fixed the iteration dialog's Stop button giving no feedback on slow connections — it now turns disabled immediately and surfaces the abort state.

### Client-side tokenizers

- Moved the JSON tokenizers for OpenAI, Claude, and the HuggingFace family fully to the browser, so the live token counter next to the chat input responds without a server round-trip.
- Extended client-side tokenization to more sentencepiece model families: gemma, gemini, llama, mistral, yi, jamba.
- Arbitrary custom model names (OpenRouter IDs, private-deployment aliases, and so on) are matched to the right tokenizer, falling back to the server only when nothing matches.
- Inactive per-chat token caches are evicted on chat switch, keeping memory flat across long sessions.

### Immersive mode & mobile

- Immersive mode state now persists across reloads and restarts, syncing with the account between the web client and the Android app.
- Added a "Keep top bar in immersive mode" toggle in user settings; with it on, the chat area resizes to leave room for the bar instead of overlapping it.
- Added a floating exit button in the top-right when immersive mode is on and the top bar is hidden, primarily so iOS users without Esc / a back key can still leave immersive mode.
- Improved Android back-button behavior: a user-toggled immersive mode no longer gets forced off by the back key; the back key now closes open popovers and dialogs first; inside a chat, the back key first closes the current chat back to the welcome page, and a second press is required to actually exit the app.
- Fixed the Android app flagging a user-initiated exit as a previous-session crash and showing the crash report dialog on next launch.
- Improved Android crash capture so JVM uncaught exceptions and WebView renderer crashes actually carry a stack trace into the next-launch crash report.
- Replaced the system DownloadManager with in-app streaming for same-origin downloads in the Android client, with a progress notification and a failure-reason toast, fixing the case where the logged-in session was isolated from DownloadManager and the backup download failed.

### Third-party extensions

- Installing extensions from github.com/funnycups/ no longer triggers the "third-party extension" security warning.
- Translated the full third-party extension install confirmation dialog (title, "Yes, install" / "No, cancel" buttons, "don't show again" option) into Simplified and Traditional Chinese.
- Fixed cross-load-order regressions when multiple extensions are enabled together — combinations like ST-Prompt-Template alongside JS-Slash-Runner now render correctly.

### Backup & files

- The user-backup restore dialog now streams progress through analyze, snapshot, and per-file extract phases (file X / Y with a percent) instead of sitting on a static "restoring" message.
- Fixed imports of character-card world-info whose names had leading or trailing whitespace: they no longer open an empty editor or show misaligned entries.

### Interface polish

- The regex extension panel now lets you collapse and expand the Preset, Global, Character, Chat, and Scoped sections independently.
- The prompt manager and the regex script list no longer accumulate memory from leftover drag bindings during long sessions.

### Other fixes

- Fixed streaming replies from multiple OpenAI-compatible sources being parsed against shared global state when several chat completion sources were active.
- Fixed the Takeover plugin carrying the previous swipe's text and reasoning into a regenerated reply.
- Fixed the Takeover plugin losing reasoning and other extras when an over-swipe past the last slot was regenerated.
- Fixed the per-message variables feature not recognizing variable shorthand: <span v-pre>`{{.x = v}}`</span>, <span v-pre>`{{.x++}}`</span>, <span v-pre>`{{$g}}`</span>, <span v-pre>`{{.x ??= 1}}`</span> now leave no literal in the message and are logged as reads or writes.
- Fixed memory-graph failing to load when its data was corrupted: orphan nodes are now auto-pruned, state can recover from the backup snapshot, and the obsolete "chat change detected, will re-sync on next generation" toast was removed.
- Fixed the connection manager attempting to sync a field that no longer exists.

### Documentation

- Added trilingual extension-API docs under docs/development/extension-api/ covering character-overrides, the Skill iteration-studio surface, and the full character-editor-assistant API; the repo also picked up a lint that forbids plugins from importing each other or the core directly — they must go through the three-layer getContext() / getExtensionApi() surface.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/funnycups/Luker/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0

## v2.5.1 (2026-05-27)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/funnycups/Luker/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1

## v2.5.0 (2026-05-27)

### Presets & help guides

- Added "Plugin Only" presets, separating role-playing settings (character design, character cards, scenes, worldbook, dialogue examples) and plugin task channels into two independent sections. Plugin commands are no longer treated as part of the AI's plot.
- Added a "?" help button next to all preset selectors: Plugin and Iterative AI presets can be imported into "Plugin Only" presets with one click; Multi-Agent presets will redirect to the Multi-Agent Getting Started Guide.
- The preset assistant's jailbreak mode also teaches the AI this section division, and generated jailbreak presets follow the new conventions.

### Preset iteration

- Expanded the range of fields that the Iterative AI can directly modify. Fields such as tool calls, agent-related switches, sampling, and multimodal can now be adjusted by the AI according to user intent.
- Added a "?" help button next to the "Reference Preset" selector, explaining what a reference preset is and when to select "None".

### Memory Graph

- Rewrote the event summary writing guidelines with a numbered outline format, category grouping by action type, and no quotation marks or repeated details, producing significantly shorter and more focused summaries.
- Event compression now merges different objects that share the same subject and action into one topic, eliminating mechanical item stacking.
- Extraction now requires the AI to check existing nodes in the graph one by one before creating or editing characters and locations, reducing redundant creation.
- Fixed the issue of the memory graph following when creating branch chats.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- The memory curation module now uses the new event summary guidelines and topic merging rules, keeping its quality consistent with the memory graph.
- Fixed the issue where the Director orchestration panel displayed "No running track in the current chat" after switching chats.

### Documentation

- Improved the Agent Getting Started Guide.

### Platform & experience

- User settings now show the compatible SillyTavern version, making it easy to check version differences.
- Status bar and navigation bar colors in the Android app now follow the theme color scheme instead of clashing with it.
- Data backup import now displays the upload progress percentage and processing status.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the send button was truncated on mobile devices in the AI iteration popups (Chat Completion Preset Assistant, Character Card Editor, Orchestrator, Memory Graph).
- Diff cards in AI iteration popups now collapse by default, long history entries no longer vertically fill the page, and mobile devices no longer hit the WebView drawing layer limit.

### Performance

- Fixed long stuttering when STscript parses long parameters (extremely long base64, commands containing many pipes).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/funnycups/Luker/compare/v2.4.1...v2.5.0

## v2.4.1 (2026-05-26)

- Fixed loading of the completion preset assistant.
- Gate agent dispatcher for orchestrator
- Fixed an issue in orchestrator sub-agents.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/funnycups/Luker/compare/v2.4.0...v2.4.1

## v2.4.0 (2026-05-25)

### Documentation

- Added a trilingual Recipes section, whose first walkthrough takes a new user end-to-end through a full multi-agent writing workflow: spinning up an agent-only preset, splitting main-writing and iteration onto separate API routes, handing memory-graph extraction/recall/compression off to sub-agents, wiring in a search engine, and finally fine-tuning everything in the AI iteration studio, with a companion minimal starter preset and step-by-step screenshots.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Each agent (main agent plus the 12 built-in sub-agents) can now have its own tool permissions, inherit-or-override per agent, with default tool sets tailored to each sub-agent's role (the memory curator gets memory-write permission, the voice critic gets read-only chat access, and so on).
- Polished the runtime trace popup so you can now read each agent's reasoning per round / per dispatch, the director panel is now a two-column layout, and the overview cards report main-agent rounds and sub-agent dispatch counts.

### AI iteration popup (shared by CardApp Studio, Memory Graph, and the Orchestrator)

- Fixed the popup stalling after you reviewed a batch of pending AI changes — Apply / Discard now resumes the loop automatically, so the AI sees which changes you accepted or rejected and adjusts its next move accordingly.
- Fixed the AI not seeing whether the previous round's changes actually landed; feedback now reports how many succeeded, how many failed and why, and which fields on which entries actually moved, so the AI stops re-proposing the same failed change.
- Fixed inline code snippets being unreadable against tinted message bubbles.
- Fixed diff cards flashing large white blocks on narrow / mobile viewports when a round proposed many changes.

### Memory Graph

- Fixed the severe data loss introduced in v2.3.0: auto extraction, auto compression, manual Fill Missing / Rebuild Recent / manual compression, and every editor add/edit/delete all looked successful in the UI but silently rolled back to an earlier state on the next refresh or message regenerate.
- Fixed silent save failures — a failed save now raises a trilingual toast with the full context so you can screenshot and report it.
- Fixed the vector recall index re-embedding 50 nodes from scratch every time you switched chats or refreshed; incremental sync now actually stays incremental across reloads.

### Preset assistant

- Added identifier-keyed tools for precisely editing prompt entries inside a preset (replace / insert / delete on content, plus enable / disable toggles), so the AI no longer mis-edits the wrong entry from index drift or retries the same dead toggle because it was writing to the wrong field.
- Rewrote the orchestrator-optimize mode guidance to split "process coercion that poisons the agent's tool-call channel" from "safe final-output decoration", producing sharper suggestions, and removed the director-preset warning banner that was a false positive.
- Fixed the "clone current preset to a new preset" tool silently failing; the clone now goes through and switches to the new preset.

### Other

- Fixed the Luker update banner showing the English source string regardless of UI language.
- Fixed an occasional "Chat patch conflict" on chat save that previously needed an auto-retry to go through.
- Fixed the CardApp third-party `sendMessage` silent option not actually being silent — messages still entered chat history; it now genuinely runs quietly and returns the AI's reply as a string to the caller.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/funnycups/Luker/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0

## v2.3.0 (2026-05-25)

### AI iteration popup

- Add a unified AI iteration popup across the five plugins — Completion Preset Assistant, Memory Graph schema, agent orchestrator, character editor, and CardApp Studio — letting the AI rework the draft right inside the popup, with split-pane live preview, multi-round dialogue, per-message tool-call visibility toggle, regenerate and rollback, inline apply with diff, auto-continue keyed to whether the AI is still calling tools, lorebook read tools, and an extension-settings entry for viewing and editing each popup's AI system prompt.

### Documentation

- Rewrite a large batch of docs covering orchestrator notes, the iteration-studio framework dev guide, and the new memory-graph API chapters, with terminology unified and CJK punctuation normalized.
- Add per-page social-card metadata to every page on the docs site.
- Round out localization for the admin panel and the AI iteration popups.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Redesign orchestrator notes as an author-voice plot-thread tracker for the AI.
- Add an intent-scout sub-agent that cross-references user intent and emits lorebook-authoring directives.
- Tighten director and memory-related sub-agent prompts so they coordinate better, follow field discipline, drill the right hierarchy, and now hard-fail on platform-frame leakage like meta-narration, substrate names, or "previous round" references.
- Rework the character-override editing flow and drop the old AI quick-build entry.
- Raise the per-task max rounds for sub-agents from 8 to 16.
- Drop the hard auto-continue cap so it follows the active context scope, and persist the finalize state.

### Memory Graph

- Add a memory-graph read-only API and a session-style extension API, so third-party extensions can read and write in one call with automatic version commit.
- Add memory-graph write and compaction APIs, a memory-curator sub-agent, and improve the built-in extraction quality.
- Improve event-summary extraction by unifying it under a 7-step reasoning template with a self-check fallback.
- Tighten the memory-generation prompts to ban author-voice tails and made-up psycho-state labels, and strengthen alias collection, relation normalization, and location-state field discipline.
- Adjust per-batch event policy so an event is required per batch, with default-skip only for stable-fact types.
- Speed up large-graph import on mobile.
- Decouple the main-context injection window from the recall candidate pool.

### CardApp & character editor

- Extend the variable system with path-based set/delete and push/pop ops, wired through slash commands, macros, the JS API, and Studio AI.
- Improve CardApp Studio file ops by batching them through a unified edit channel with per-round approval.
- Add a lorebook viewer, paging, search, and a mobile tab layout to the character editor.
- Let the character editor's AI tools read and write lorebook recursion fields directly.

### In-app announcements

- Add an in-app announcement system that admins can publish through, with the bell auto-hidden in single-user mode and tri-lingual usage docs included.

### Stability & observability

- Significantly improve chat-save reliability, fixing several intermittent message-loss, missing-event, and post-edit/delete save-conflict issues.
- Add automatic request retry with per-profile retry counts, benefiting both text and image generation.
- Dump in-flight requests on process exit and emit diagnostic reports on native aborts.
- Show each request's upstream endpoint and key fingerprint in the request inspector, and surface the outbound wire payload alongside source messages.
- Capture all console levels into the frontend log buffer regardless of debug mode, so the exported debug log is complete.
- Improve the takeover flow with three explicit terminal states — committed, aborted, discarded — and a live timer plus final token count on the bubble.

### Security & access

- Add an opt-in self-service registration entry.

### Other experience

- Expose Claude and Gemini prompt-cache toggles in the connection profile.
- Add a manual entry manager popup to the search tools for maintaining stored entries.

## v2.2.0 (2026-05-17)

### Multi-Agent Orchestrator

- **New Director mode.** An eight-agent ensemble — chat / memory / lorebook / epistemic / canon scouts, a plot brainstormer, and voice / continuity critics — produces the assistant message body directly through the takeover hook, bypassing the main LLM dispatch entirely. Director carries its own bundled `pure-preset` snapshot that is swapped in for the duration of each run so Main Prompt / NSFW / jailbreak / anti-cliché text from your active preset cannot leak into sub-agent context, with snapshot + restore mirroring the LittleWhiteBox pattern. Profiles can be exported and re-imported as JSON. The two critics were rewritten: `voice_critic` now hunts "data-person" prose (cold observation verbs, reporting-style dialogue, archetype mishandling, with a bilingual banned-term list aimed at Chinese RP); `continuity_critic` trusts the draft by default and only flags hard contradictions and knowledge-boundary violations.
- **New tools cascade.** The loop toolset (chat / memory / lorebook / note / search) can now be enabled on every orchestration node — loop mode itself, spec nodes, agenda agents, and director's main agent + sub-agents — all sharing the same `profile.tools.<ns>.<verb>` flag shape. Resolution is three-tier: per-node override → profile-root `defaultTools` → built-in. The UI exposes a profile-wide panel above the workflow board plus a per-node "Tools (override profile default)" collapsible at the bottom of every node body, with Enable-all / Clear-all quick actions.
- **Runtime trace panel expanded.** The existing trace popup now also exposes the full message thread of every node attempt and the loop agent — system / user / assistant / tool turns rendered as role-styled bubbles with collapsible tool_call and tool_result blocks. Agenda mode additionally gains a kanban-style todo board and per-round dispatch cards; the loop panel updates live, so messages added during rounds show up in real time.
- Fix: Anthropic's tool-name regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$` rejects dots, so loop mode failed immediately when paired with Claude. The eleven loop tool names (`chat_read_range`, `chat_search`, `lorebook_search/get`, `memory_search/list_recent/get`, `note_add/delete`, `search_search/visit`) were renamed to underscore form, with a migration shim that normalises dotted names from older history so saved profiles and persisted tool-call payloads keep working.
- Fix: the global mode-selector dropdown was being overridden by `character.savedMode` inside dispatch, so a character with a spec override forced spec even after the user clicked loop. Dispatch now honours the most recent mode-selector click, matching what the UI scope label already showed.
- Fix: the orchestrator settings panel only subscribed to `CHAT_CHANGED`, so replacing a character card or AI-driven field writes left the panel showing the previous character's override-source label. It now also listens for `CHARACTER_REPLACED`, `CHARACTER_FIELDS_UPDATED`, and `CHARACTER_EDITED`.
- Docs: every mode opens with a default-flow diagram (loop / spec / agenda / director), default agents are tabulated with concrete RP examples carried through a shared Lin Wan / Luoyang scenario, and the trace-panel sections in each mode page include real-run screenshots.

### Memory Graph

- **Per-type extraction cadence and instructions.** Node types now carry two new fields: `extractEveryN` (default 1) gates the type to every Nth pass via `currentSeq % N == 0`, and `extractionInstructions` is appended to the extraction system prompt only when the type is active for the current round. When a type sits out a pass, its create / edit / delete tools are not exposed to the LLM at all — the model literally cannot output that table this round, so slow-changing tables like `location_state` save LLM calls without confusing the extraction agent.
- Fix: `isExtractableAssistantMessage` treated `is_system` as a permanent exclusion, but `/hide` flips that flag on existing assistant turns — so every hide/unhide shifted the extractable-seq rank, drifting stored node seqs against chat. Hidden turns now contribute the same memory weight as visible ones, matching the community convention that `/hide` controls prompt visibility, not memory.
- Fix: hybrid recall (vector + diffusion + optional rerank) kept running when `recallEnabled` was off, while the LLM recall path short-circuited via its internal guard. The recallEnabled check is now lifted above both branches so disabled-recall is uniform; `alwaysInjectNodes` ownership was also moved out of the recall functions so persistent lorebook injection still publishes the right id set to orchestrator dedup.
- Fix: manual `/delete` + immediate regenerate could run `MESSAGE_DELETED`'s cache refresh and the regenerate's WI-scan recall on two interleaved click stacks, so the recall read stale store cache. Mutation invalidation is now serialised through a module-level promise chain and the recall listener awaits the in-flight task.
- Fix: the edge editor was throwing "Edge form not found" because `openEdgeEditor` read form values via `jQuery` after `callGenericPopup` resolved — but `Popup#hide()` removes the dialog from the DOM before the promise resolves. Values are now captured inside the `onClosing` handler. The built-in edge-type preset list was also realigned to the canonical schema (added `involved_in / occurred_at / evidence / updates / advances`, dropped non-canonical `involves`, removed forbidden `located_at`).

### Request Inspector

- Tool calls returned by the model are now visible in the Response Body. Each `tool_call` renders as a card with a badge, name, id, and pretty-printed argument JSON, with a count surfaced in the section header. OpenAI `tool_calls`, Claude `tool_use` content blocks, and Gemini `functionCall` parts are all parsed (including streaming reassembly: index-merged OpenAI deltas, Claude `content_block_*` walks, Gemini interleaved text-and-function parts). Detail-level search now matches tool names and argument JSON too.

### Connection Manager

- **Reverse Proxy settings have been folded into a new "API Endpoint" drawer.** The drawer manages base URL and reverse-proxy password together — previously these lived in separate panels with overlapping semantics and ambiguous precedence. This refactor uncovered three follow-on issues, all fixed in the same release: cross-source plugin reuse let the main API's `base_url` bleed into the sub-profile (Claude main API with `base_url` ending in `/v1` carried over into a Gemini sub-profile, producing `https://claude-proxy/v1/v1beta/models/...:generateContent`); `ConnectionManagerRequestService.sendRequest` never forwarded `profile['base-url']` to the backend, so Gemini through an OAI-compatible proxy ending in `/v1` composed `/v1/v1beta/...:generateContent` and threw "Invalid URL"; and the proxy-password migration to the secret store made `readProviderSecret(...) || body.proxy_password || ''` short-circuit on any stale stored provider secret, silently overriding an explicit `proxy_password` shipped in the body — JS-Slash-Runner third-party scripts that supplied their own keys through `custom_api.key` had them replaced by a stale stored MAKERSUITE secret.
- **New per-profile RPM limit with a wait toast.** A sliding-window throttler gates both the plugin path (`ConnectionManagerRequestService.sendRequest`) and the main chat-completion path; bucket key is the profile id, so a profile reused across plugin and main chat shares the same window. A persistent toast shows a live "queued · next in Ns" countdown while waiting; `AbortSignal` cancels cleanly; `0` or unset = unlimited; text-completion paths are not gated.
- **New Embedding / Rerank tab inside the Connection Profile drawer.** Embedding and rerank profile management has been pulled out of Vector Storage and Memory Graph into a unified, inline-editing UI. The chat API panel auto-hides on those tabs to keep the visible source / url / key from suggesting it relates to the embedding profile being edited. Plugin pages keep only the profile-picker dropdown with a sync that clears the persisted id when the underlying profile is removed elsewhere. The deprecated SillyTavern Extras embedding source is dropped.
- **Unified input-driven model picker across reverse-proxy-capable sources** (OpenAI / Claude / Mistral / DeepSeek / xAI / Moonshot / Makersuite / VertexAI / ZAI plus the existing Custom). The text input is now the source of truth, the sibling `<select>` is a one-shot picker that mirrors it, and a `<datalist>` provides typeahead. The previous select-only flow forced `oai_settings.<X>_model` back to `model_list[0]` whenever the saved id was missing from a freshly fetched `/v1/models` response, silently overwriting custom ids that ship through reverse proxies whose listings don't enumerate them.
- Fix: `normalizeOpenAIBaseUrl` only checked the path's tail for `/vN`. Vendors that nest a category after the version (e.g. Baidu Qianfan's `/v2/coding`) had `/v1` wrongly appended, turning every request into a 404. Match `/vN` anywhere in the path now.
- Fix: refreshing the model list could re-insert the currently selected model into the dropdown even when it wasn't part of the freshly fetched list, leaving a non-listed entry pinned to the selector.

### Characters / CardApp / Studio

- **New data-driven character update API (`updateCharacterData`).** Character-field writes used to go through jQuery DOM (`$('#description_textarea').val(x)`) and rely on a synthetic click of the popup's save button; when the editor popup was closed the DOM elements didn't exist, so writes silently no-op'd while `saveCharacterDebounced` still fired (sometimes leaving ghost state, like a `data.character_book` mirror after a primary-world rebind that never actually rebound). The new API patches `characters[charId].data` with a dot-path map, emits `CHARACTER_FIELDS_UPDATED`, and persists via the same multipart shape `/api/characters/edit` already expects. Studio AI's `character_update_fields`, CardApp's `ctx.updateCharacterFields`, world-info's `charUpdatePrimaryWorld`, and orchestrator's persistence path all route through it now, so binding a world to a card works whether the editor popup is open or not.
- **New extension-field write semantics (`writeExtensionField` / `writeExtensionFieldBulk`).** These now opt into a `replacePaths` flag on `/api/characters/merge-attributes`: the full value becomes `data.extensions[key]` verbatim — sibling subkeys that the previous deep-merge silently preserved are no longer carried over. `updateCharacterData` now throws synchronously on `extensions.*` paths and points callers at `writeExtensionField`, so the silent-merge footgun is impossible to trip by accident.
- **New auto-apply toggle.** Both the iteration-studio shell (reused by the orchestrator AI iteration popup, the memory-graph schema editor, and any third-party plugin that adopts the shell) and the CardApp Studio composer now ship an auto-apply toggle: when on, write / patch tools land immediately instead of rendering the inline Approve / Reject card. Preference persists per extension.
- **CardApps can read character auxiliary world books.** `ctx.getCharacterAuxWorldBooks()` and an extended `ctx.getWorldBooks()` surface books bound via `world_info.charLore[].extraBooks` alongside the primary book. Pass `{ withSource: true }` to `getWorldBooks` to receive tagged entries with `source: 'character' | 'character_aux' | 'chat' | 'global'`.
- **Authoring vs runtime scope was split across the three exposure layers.** CardApp `ctx` no longer leaks `.jsonl` / `sidecar` filesystem terms, and chat lifecycle methods (`closeCurrentChat`, `doNewChat`, `getPastCharacterChats`, `deleteCharacterChat`) are now properly exposed via `getContext()` so third-party extensions can manage chats without reaching into private internals.
- Studio AI's world-book tools were unified around an explicit `book_name` argument. `list / query / get / upsert / delete_lorebook_entry` no longer fall back to the implicit primary-book; the new `luker_card_list_world_books` is the discovery entry point. Studio's `worldinfo_list_books` gains a `character_aux` source, and a new `worldinfo_search_entries` provides keyword search inside one book without loading the full entry set.
- Fix: when Studio AI returned prose + tool_calls in the same response, the chat showed the approval dialog (or tool result in auto-apply mode) before the explanatory text. `onAssistantText` now fires immediately after parsing, so UI order matches generation order.
- Fix: CardApp Studio's static reads (`fetchFileList`, `fetchFileContent`) and the runtime's `style.css` fetch hit the browser HTTP cache silently — the editor and AI's `read_file` could see stale content even after server-side `no-store` middleware was in place. Client-side `cache: 'no-cache'` is now explicit for these calls.
- Fix: `charaFormatData` invoked `syncCharacterBookFromWorldInfo` on every character save, serialising the bound world's full content into `data.character_book` — meant for sharing a card via PNG / JSON, not as a runtime mirror. The stale mirror later tripped `checkEmbeddedWorld` into popping the "import embedded lorebook" dialog for content the user manages elsewhere. Saves no longer write the mirror.
- Fix: three bugs in the post-character-replace lorebook sync popup conspired to turn the buttons into vertical "send" labels and let the AI-fallback path destructively replace both the old and new world books on failure. CSS scope is now anchored to `.luker-studio` so menu-button rules apply, and the destructive replace path was salvaged so failure no longer loses content.
- Fix: bulk filesystem operations (delete + recreate same-named cards, rename, import) didn't invalidate the in-memory recent-chat index, so the welcome screen's "Recent Chats" surfaced stale entries — including chats that no longer existed on disk, returning 400 when the user tried to delete them. Index is now invalidated at the same three call sites that already handle bulk fs changes for characters / groups.
- Fix: after a programmatic write to `characters[chid].data.extensions.world` via `updateCharacterData`, the hidden `#character_world` input still held the old value (the editor popup is a `display:none` div, not a dynamically mounted modal, so its 13 form-attribute associations are always live). A later form-based save would round-trip the stale value back. The form is now kept in sync after data-driven writes.

### Chat-Save / Floor Sync

- **409 chat-write conflicts are now visible to users.** Previously these were silently auto-recovered via rebuild-diff-retry (patch path) or refresh-retry (append path) — users and tests had no way to see drift happening, and the rebuild path itself recomputed a JSON Patch diff against fresh server state, producing wrong sub-replaces when messages shifted. A 409 now fires a "Chat write conflict" warning toast with endpoint name + first-three-ops summary + sent integrity slug, emits `CHAT_WRITE_CONFLICT` for instrumentation, dumps the client / server / live three-way comparison for each divergent index to the console, and resolves divergent fields down to nested paths rather than coarse top-level names — then routes to the full-save fallback every caller already had as a backup.
- Fix: the in-snapshot integrity slug was captured synchronously at queue time, so a queued save could ship with stale integrity if another save advanced the server in the meantime — the auto-illustrator plugin hit this on every image generation. Each send now refreshes integrity from the live `chat_metadata` immediately before transmitting (both single-chat and three group-save paths).
- Fix: the divergence diagnostic was reporting false positives when the client-side snapshot carried a `Date` object and the server fetch carried the equivalent ISO string for the same position — the underlying values serialise to the same JSON literal, so the server's `test` op accepts them as equal. The diagnostic now uses the same JSON-shape comparison the server applies, so identical-on-the-wire fields no longer get flagged.
- Fix: aborting a generation right before flush and then clicking regenerate produced a benign 409 (snapshot ≡ server, both diverged from the now-corrected client). The fallback full-save corrected it cleanly, but the user saw a misleading "chat write conflict" toast. This specific shape (`kind === 'snapshot'` and `divergence === null`) is now suppressed at the toast layer; the diagnostic event and console.warn still fire.
- The `luker_generation_id` retry-dedup token moved from `chat[N].extra` into an in-memory map keyed by chat path with a 60-second TTL per entry. The field no longer pollutes the persisted jsonl and no longer drives `mutated:[extra.luker_generation_id]` false positives in the 409 diagnostic.
- Perf: external-script variable updates triggered the full save chain on every write. `saveMetadata` now skips the chat clone in its metadata-only path (relying on the existing live-slice fallback), and `saveTokenCache` / `saveItemizedPrompts` coalesce via 1-second debounce with a dirty flag, flushed on `beforeunload`, on chat reload, and when a different chat takes ownership of itemizedPrompts.
- Fix: an upstream merge re-added `saveChatConditional` to the push-to-tail branch of `sendMessageAsUser`, but the previous `appendChatMessages` call was still in place. Every user message was being written twice (patch from a snapshot taken before `MESSAGE_SENT` / `USER_MESSAGE_RENDERED`, then again via append after those emits), and any listener that touched `message.extra` between the emits broke the dedup and produced a duplicate user message at the tail. The duplicate call is removed; the fallback design is restored.

### Generation / Task Stream

- **New `generateTaskStream` split-stream API for OpenAI-family streaming.** Returns `{ stream, result }`: an `AsyncIterable` of text / reasoning delta chunks alongside a Promise of the same normalised terminal result shape `generateTask` returns. `jsonSchema` works under streaming (chunks carry partial JSON, `result.jsonData` holds the parsed object); `tools+jsonSchema` mutex still throws synchronously; non-OpenAI providers throw `stream_unavailable` synchronously to enforce the user's explicit opt-in. Exposed at `getContext().generateTaskStream`.
- **New "Use streaming transport" toggle in five built-in plugins** (search-tools, completion-preset-assistant, orchestrator, memory-graph, character-editor-assistant; default OFF). When on, the plugin's `generateTask` calls wrap to `generateTaskStream(opts).result`, keeping the HTTP connection alive on long generations to avoid idle timeout on slow APIs. Non-OpenAI providers throw `stream_unavailable` rather than silently falling back, since silent fallback would violate the explicit opt-in.
- **`generateTask` now substitutes macros in caller-supplied `taskMessages` by default.** <span v-pre>`{{user}}`</span> / <span v-pre>`{{char}}`</span> / <span v-pre>`{{datetime}}`</span> / <span v-pre>`{{getvar::}}`</span> and any other shared-engine macro resolve at request time, with side-effect macros (`setvar` / `addvar` / ...) stripped via `skipSideEffects:true` so per-call substitution can't mutate `chat_metadata.variables`. Authoring flows (character editor, lorebook diff analysis, preset editor, CardApp Studio AI) opt out with `substituteMacros:false` because their job is to read or edit text containing literal <span v-pre>`{{...}}`</span> markers.
- Thinking activation is now driven by `reasoning_effort` instead of `show_thoughts`. Previously `show_thoughts` doubled as the on/off switch for thinking on DeepSeek / Moonshot / Z.AI, contradicting its "visibility only" UI label. Now `auto` omits all thinking parameters (let the provider default decide), any explicit tier sends `thinking.type='enabled'`, and `show_thoughts` retains visibility-only semantics across all providers. Gemini 2.5 Flash / Flash-Lite / Pro `auto` returns `null` instead of `-1` so `thinkingBudget` is also omitted.
- The Prompt-Post-Processing dropdown was collapsed from 7 options to 4 (`Merge` / `Semi` / `Strict` / `Single`). The `_TOOLS` variants only differed by 8 lines stripping tool role / tool_calls — legacy compat for backends that no longer apply. Old preset values (`merge_tools` / `semi_tools` / `strict_tools`) auto-migrate on load, and the misleading "no tools" warning on the function-calling toggle is rewritten to point precisely at `Single` (the only truly incompatible option).
- Fix: when upstream 1.17.0 split `generateRaw` into `generateRaw` + `generateRawData` (PR #5249), the openai-source branch's references to `llmPresetName` / `apiPresetName` / `apiSettingsOverride` ended up inside `generateRawData`, but the parameter list those three were added to stayed on `generateRaw`. Any caller hitting the openai path through `ctx.generateRaw` threw `ReferenceError: llmPresetName is not defined`. The parameter list now matches the shared typedef on both functions.
- Fix: non-streaming responses from Claude, Gemini, and Cohere weren't lifted to the chat-completion shape `generateTask` and friends expect. Claude only wrapped `content[0].text`, silently dropping `tool_use` and thinking blocks; Gemini detected `functionCall` on candidates but never emitted it into the reply; Cohere was forwarded as-is and had no `choices[]` at all, so `normalizeResponse` threw "openai sender returned no choices". `generateTask` callers (character editor, orchestrator task nodes, memory-graph) now work with all three providers in non-streaming mode.
- Fix: `ToolManager.parseToolCalls` short-circuits on the global `function_calling` toggle. The wip director branch added a `force` parameter to bypass that gate for extension callers that explicitly supplied tools (director-runtime, `generateTaskStream`), but the call site wiring was missing — so Claude `tool_use` content blocks were silently dropped from the streaming pipeline whenever the user kept the toggle off. The streaming sender now passes `force: normalizedTools.length > 0`, gating the bypass to requests that actually opted into tool calling.
- Fix: <span v-pre>`\{{...}}`</span> escapes in world book / extension prompts (teaching examples for side-effect macros like `setvar` / `addvar`) were leaking the leading backslash into the LLM's prompt, so the model would copy <span v-pre>`\{{setvar::a::1}}`</span> back into its reply and both the macro engine and op-log scanner honoured the escape — chat variables silently never updated. Brace-escape stripping is now confined to the generation request boundary.

### Message Takeover (Public Extension API)

- **New `createMessageEditorHandle` API plus `GENERATE_TAKEOVER_DISPATCH` event.** Plugins can now produce the assistant message body directly, bypassing the main LLM dispatch for the turn. The kernel owns chat-array mutation, DOM redraw, `MESSAGE_UPDATED` emission, placeholder push, post-generation pipeline (regex AI_OUTPUT, chat-save, tool-call detection), and `saveReply` routing — plugins focus on content generation. Director mode is the in-tree consumer; the kernel itself is plugin-agnostic.

### Variables

- **`setVariable(name, value, { floor? })`** is exposed on `script.js`, `getContext()`, and CardApp `ctx`. Without `floor` it writes straight to `chat_metadata.variables` (chat-scoped, persists for the rest of the chat). With `floor` it pushes a synthetic setvar op into `chat[floor].extra.var_ops` via the variable op-log, mirrored to that floor's current swipe — so deletion, swipe-out, swipe-back, and branching all reconcile through the rebuilder and roll back the same way an AI-written <span v-pre>`{{setvar}}`</span> literal would. The floor-bound path coerces value to string (op-log carries strings only); for structured per-floor state with its own commit log, use `ctx.lukerContext.createFloorState({ namespace })` instead.

### Iteration Studio (Developer API)

- **The AI iteration popup framework was extracted out of orchestrator into a reusable `iteration-studio` shell** at `public/scripts/iteration-studio/`. Adapters declare what an artifact looks like (`cloneWorkingProfile` + `getInitialProfile`), which tools edit it, how prompts are built, and how it persists. The shell owns popup lifecycle, conversation, history, abort, auto-continue, the auto-apply toggle, the LLM round-trip, and diff rendering (object recursion + inline line / word diff with zoom + splitter overlay). Two reference adapters ship: `orchestrator/iteration-adapter.js` (the existing AI iteration UI, now 47 lines instead of 480) and `memory-graph/schema-adapter.js` (new — an AI-edited node-type schema, opened from a new "AI Iterate Schema" button next to the schema editor). Third-party plugins consume it through `getContext().iterationStudio.{ open, defineAdapter, createSettingsBackedHistoryStore, ... }`.

### World Info

- Fix: the editor's `<select>` change handler treated every fire as a book switch and wiped the active search / filter, but two paths fired it on data-only updates — `reloadEditor` (via `WORLDINFO_UPDATED`, entry toggles, slash commands) and `deleteWorldInfo`'s post-list refresh. `reloadEditor` now reloads via `showWorldEditor` directly when the same book is selected, and `deleteWorldInfo` only re-fires change when the edited book actually changed, so deleting an unrelated book no longer clears the user's active search.

### Presets

- Fix: `persistPreset` diffed `existingPreset` against `preset` to compute a JSON Patch, but extensions like JS-Slash-Runner take a reference from `preset_list.presets[i]`, mutate it in place, then call `savePreset(name, sameRef)`. Both diff inputs aliased the same object, the patch was always empty, and `persistPreset` returned `mode='noop'` without hitting the server — so script deletions / toggles silently reverted on refresh. The patch path is dropped entirely; saves always POST the full preset to `/api/presets/save`.

### User Backup

- **Overwrite-mode restore is now snapshot-and-rollback.** Previously a restore deleted all selected category directories upfront (`rm -rf`), then streamed the archive into newly recreated empty ones — any failure during extraction (corrupted zip entry, disk full, process kill) left users with deleted old data and a partial new state, permanently losing whatever didn't get extracted. The upfront delete is replaced with a rename to `<path>.restore-snapshot-<ts>-<hex>`; on success the snapshots are discarded, on extraction failure the partial writes are cleared and the snapshots are renamed back into place. Disk usage briefly doubles for the duration of extraction, but renames are O(1) inode operations and the safety margin is now non-negotiable.
- Fix: after a successful `restoreUserBackupArchive` (or `/lan-migration/import` or `/import/data-zip`), the in-memory `recentChatIndexCache` still pointed at the pre-restore filesystem snapshot, so the welcome screen's recent-chats list looked stale even though opening a character card showed the freshly imported chats. The index is now invalidated at the same three endpoints right after the restore completes.
- Fix: the blue "Please wait..." progress toast lingered behind the success + warning toasts and the diagnostic report modal whenever a restore finished with warnings, because `toastr.clear` was only called from the finally block and `await showRestoreDiagnosticReport` kept the try block alive until the user dismissed the modal. The toast is now cleared inline as soon as the restore promise resolves, in both the Backup-and-Restore and LAN-Migration-import paths.
- The "Import Data ZIP" button in the Backup and Restore panel was a functional duplicate of "Select All + Restore Backup" (both POSTed to `/api/users/restore-backup`; the only difference was that this button ignored checkboxes and hard-coded `BACKUP_FULL_SELECTION`). Removed from the panel; the migration-from-Termux docs were updated across three languages to describe the six-step Backup and Restore flow. The same-named onboarding-wizard button targets a different endpoint and is preserved.

### Generation Recovery

- The in-flight recovery preview is now rendered as an **inline assistant-message bubble at the end of the chat** instead of a separate banner, using the same `.mes` layout (avatar + ch_name + mes_text) so it visually reads as the message that's currently being generated. A dashed-border status chip makes the recovering state explicit; the bubble is pure DOM and never touches `chat[]`, so the placeholder disappears cleanly when `reloadCurrentChat()` draws the persisted message in its place. It scrolls into view on first render.
- The client now streams recovery events over SSE (`/jobs/events-stream`) instead of polling `/jobs/status` at 1Hz. Server-side: a per-job listener set notifies subscribers on each `appendGenerationEvent` plus every terminal status transition (`awaiting_ack` / `persisting` / `completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`); the endpoint emits an initial replay-from-after_seq and then live `event` / `status` frames until terminal status. Client-side: `EventSource` auto-reconnects on transient errors; only a `CLOSED` ready state falls back to reload. Older clients or restrictive proxies that lack `EventSource` automatically use the 1Hz poll fallback.

### Admin Console

- Saves and imports of the server config that would prevent the next startup are now rejected pre-flight, with a localised message explaining what to fix. The two checked invariants are: (a) with `listen` on you must enable one of `whitelistMode` / `basicAuthMode` / `enableUserAccounts` (or set `securityOverride: true`), and (b) at least one of `protocol.ipv4` / `protocol.ipv6` must be enabled or set to `"auto"`. Changing the config no longer leaves you discovering at next launch that the server refuses to start.

### Server

- Fix: two paths could terminate the backend with empty stderr. The console wrapper installed for `backendLogBuffer` ran `JSON.stringify` on every non-string argument without a try-catch, so a circular reference or BigInt in any `console.*` argument made the wrapper throw `TypeError`; inside `process.on('uncaughtException')` the re-entered wrapper threw again and Node aborted, with the trailing `original(...args)` never reached. And Express 4 does not forward async route handler rejections to `next(err)`, so with no `unhandledRejection` listener Node 20+ promoted the rejection to `uncaughtException` and fed straight into the hijack-abort path. Both are now defensive: the wrapper falls back to `util.inspect` then `String()` and isolates buffer bookkeeping; an explicit `unhandledRejection` listener keeps a single failing request from killing the process.

### Android App

- WebView render-process death, native crashes, OOM kills, and ANRs all tear down the activity before `MainActivity` can write anything, so users used to see a loading spinner and a silent exit. `LukerCrashCapture` now reads the most recent abnormal exit via `ApplicationExitInfo` (API 30+) on next launch — `CRASH`, `CRASH_NATIVE`, `ANR`, `LOW_MEMORY`, `DEPENDENCY_DIED`, `SIGNALED`, `EXCESSIVE_RESOURCE_USAGE`, `INITIALIZATION_FAILURE` — pulls the full `traceInputStream` for ANR / native cases, persists to `filesDir/luker-last-crash-report.txt`, and shows it in a dialog with copy / share buttons. A per-package timestamp keeps the same report from re-popping. Below API 30 the poll silently no-ops.

### Updater

- Fix: Node 20.12+ rejects spawning `.cmd` / `.bat` directly without `shell: true` (CVE-2024-27980 hardening), so the post-pull `npm install` step failed with `spawn EINVAL` on Windows even though the `git pull` itself succeeded. `shell: true` is now set on win32; args remain hardcoded literals, so no shell-injection surface is added.

### Extensions Platform

- Extension activation is now actually parallel: previously the inner per-extension `await` chain inside the `for` loop made the trailing `Promise.allSettled(promises)` effectively a no-op, and the local `promise` var only held the pre-activate stages anyway. The `.then(activate)` and `.catch` are now folded into the chain stored in `promise` and the in-loop `await` is dropped, so `Promise.allSettled` at the end of the loop genuinely waits for activation to finish in parallel. The `manifest.dependencies` presence check is preserved.

### Miscellaneous

- The system avatar and welcome assistant now use the Luker logo (`img/logo.png`) instead of the SillyTavern logo; the `/echo` help example was updated and the orphaned `img/five.png` removed.
- Documentation: five new extension-API reference pages (World Info, Characters, Slash Commands, Macros & Variables, UI & Popups), with existing pages expanded across chat lifecycle, swipe API, extension prompts, media helpers, prompt envelope inspection, reasoning helpers, settings views, low-level generation primitives, service classes, i18n, settings storage, debug and scraper registration, tokenization, utilities, and symbols / constants. A new basics/macros guide ships across en / zh-CN / zh-TW. All changes mirrored to all three locales.
- Documentation: clicking the top nav on a zh-CN / zh-TW docs page no longer drops the reader on the English version — nav, sidebar, doc footer, outline, search labels, footer, and UI strings now live in per-locale `themeConfig`. A full triple-language audit also caught and fixed `changelog.md` being entirely zh-CN under an English title, plus four cross-language internal links in `memory-graph.md`.

### ★ Documentation

https://luker.cups.moe

The official Luker documentation, covering most of Luker's improvements, built-in plugin usage guides, plugin development specs, and more — kept in sync across Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English.

- Add a tri-lingual (zh-CN, zh-TW, EN) doc site as the single entry point for plugins, extension APIs, the CardApp spec, the memory graph, and more
- Add usage guides for the orchestrator, memory graph, CardApp, Studio, Floor State, per-message variables, auto-migration notes, and more, with screenshots and flow diagrams
- Add a server-plugin development guide and a preset API reference

### ★ CardApp & CardApp Studio

https://luker.cups.moe/features/cardapp.html
https://luker.cups.moe/features/card-editor/studio.html
https://luker.cups.moe/features/card-editor/walkthrough.html
https://luker.cups.moe/development/card-developers.html

CardApp is Luker's standardized form for "frontend character cards"; Studio is an AI-assisted code editor for CardApp authors — write, edit, and run all in one place.

- Add CardApp frontend character cards: a full kit covering server + frontend, CSS auto-isolation, the message render pipeline, chat/character-field/world-info APIs, AI tool definitions and an execution loop
- Add CardApp Studio: code editor, change-approval + diff view, multi-session, code autocomplete, one-click Git rollback, hot reload, full tri-lingual UI
- Iterate on Studio's prompt and toolset so AI-written code holds up
- Add world-binding: AI inside Studio can write AI-facing text straight into bound world-info entries.
- Mobile layout for Studio: bottom tab bar and responsive layout.

### ★ Multi-Agent Orchestration

https://luker.cups.moe/features/orchestrator/

- Add loop mode: a single agent runs its own tool loop, with a default loop prompt and a "delete note" tool
- Dispatch an event when orchestration succeeds so other plugins can pick up from there
- Loop mode can read and write the memory graph directly
- Persist iteration sessions
- Drop the hard iteration limit
- Add RPM rate limiting

### ★ Completion Preset Assistant

https://luker.cups.moe/features/preset-assistant.html

Add the Chat Completion Preset Assistant: an AI helper for editing presets, prompts, and world-info, with step-by-step previews — preset maintenance in one place.

- Rich toolset: default-preset creation, field readers, world-info toggles, assembled-prompt preview, etc.
- Persist session history and tool-call traces so you can step back through them
- Preset edits can be rolled back through change history

### Memory Graph

https://luker.cups.moe/features/memory-graph.html

- Add the hybrid recall pipeline (graph diffusion + cognitive operators)
- Add HTML-table rendering for the injection preview, plus responsive node-detail and injection-viewer layouts with copy support and collapsible search
- Automatic schema migration: legacy chats upgrade on load, with cycle protection and fallback, so nothing gets stuck
- Add two import modes (restore to original floor / bind to current floor)
- Rewrite event-compression rules: tighter summaries, rollup gets its own ruleset, flat compression across depths is supported
- Migrate onto the new Floor State core service so memory commits along floor-aligned diffs with cleaner semantics
- Add RPM rate limiting
- Improve the recall prompt structure to reduce token consumption.
- Remove legacy schemas and unused code paths; the prompt is leaner.

### Floor state

https://luker.cups.moe/features/state-system.html

Add Floor State — state that naturally rolls back and forward with the message floor; a win for plugin authors.

- Instance API for plugin authors, targeting specific floors or branches
- Branch chats inherit the commit log
- Orchestrator, search tools, and memory graph all migrated onto it

### Per-message variables

https://luker.cups.moe/features/variable-op-log.html

- Add the per-message variables feature: variable changes contributed by each message can be inspected and managed individually
- All variables involved in a chat automatically roll back or update as messages are deleted, swiped, or regenerated

### Unified message API

https://luker.cups.moe/improvements/generation-layer.html

- Support nested sub-groups
- Add advanced prompt search

### World info

https://luker.cups.moe/basics/world-info.html
https://luker.cups.moe/features/world-info-trace.html

- Add a bulk field-edit toolbar across every editable field, with single-field, composite (Trigger Strategy), tri-state (Matched Fields), and Injection Depth dialogs; one-click rollback
- Add configurable editor-field visibility so seldom-used fields can be hidden
- Expanded bulk entry actions
- Improve the search experience and add advanced search
- Full tri-lingual; mobile layout improved

### Extension API

https://luker.cups.moe/development/frontend-plugin.html
https://luker.cups.moe/development/server-plugin.html
https://luker.cups.moe/development/extension-api/

- Add an extension-API registry and lookup

- Add a one-stop request API: connection profile, preset, message assembly, streaming — handled in one shot
- Add local Git capabilities for Studio and other upper-layer plugins
- Expose preset APIs to plugins
- Drop the old extras API

### WebSocket proxy

https://luker.cups.moe/improvements/ws-proxy.html

### Logs & debugging

- Timestamps on all frontend and backend console logs
- Add one-click debug-log export with auto key redaction so it can be sent back as feedback directly
- Enhanced logging for Luker persistence

### Security & authentication

https://luker.cups.moe/guide/authentication.html

- Auto-provision a random password for unprotected admin accounts on boot instead of leaving them open
- Fix the built-in updater being unable to run in some scenarios
- Bypass basic auth for the LAN migration path; Android WebView handles Basic Auth prompts

### Model channels

- Fix bootstrap responses carrying PNG data, which made the payload huge
- Fix reasoning slash commands not being registered during initialization
- Fix OpenAI error handling and prompt referencing, prompt-token-limit miscalculation, and SD exception handling
- Fix blob/iframe download handling

### Core optimizations

- Switched major save flows to a patch-first model (RFC 6902), significantly reducing repeated full-file rewrites and network traffic usage.
- Improved incremental save conflict handling and runtime stability.
- Decoupled chat preset and API selection for more flexible model routing.
- Added character-scoped bindings for user personas and presets without polluting global defaults.
- Character-scoped persona/preset bindings are exported and imported together with character cards.
- Added OAuth login support for GitHub and Discord.
- Added per-user storage quota controls and default user quota assignment.

### World info

- Added a traceable World Info activation chain, so you can inspect why an entry was activated and what triggered it.
- World Info writes now follow patch-first incremental updates.

### Built-in features

- Orchestrator (Multi-Agent): supports serial/parallel stages, AI-generated orchestration profiles, character-scoped configuration, profile import/export, and human-readable diff-based approval workflow.
- Memory Graph: improved graph-based memory extraction/linking, iterative recall, partial rebuild for recent turns, character-scoped schema settings, graph import/export for current chat, and better graph presentation.
- Character Editor Assistant: AI-assisted editing for character fields and lorebook content, with diff review, approval, and rollback history.
- During Character Card Replace/Update, a guided panel now asks whether to keep the current worldbook, replace it with the new worldbook, or use the AI to compare the old and new worldbooks and apply an updated version.
- Diff UX has been improved, including a zoomable line-by-line diff view.

### Android app

- Added Android app support for Luker runtime usage.
- Improved WebView interoperability for file/media flows (SAF picker, blob/data download handling, permission bridge).
- Supports extension installation in the Android app.

### Backup & restore

- Added built-in Backup/Restore with selectable data categories.
