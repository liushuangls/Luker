# Iteration Studio Framework

A shared popup shell for **AI-driven iterative editing of an adapter-supplied artifact**. The shell drives the conversation, tool dispatch, drift-aware apply, history list, and approve/reject UI; the plugin (via an adapter) supplies what is being edited, which tools propose changes, and where sessions are stored.

Reference adapters live in-tree:

- `public/scripts/extensions/orchestrator/iteration-adapter.js` — edits orchestrator profiles (spec / agenda / loop)
- `public/scripts/extensions/memory-graph/schema-adapter.js` — edits memory-graph node-type schema

This page is the contract and walkthrough for building your own adapter.

## What it is

An Iteration Studio session is a popup chat between the user and an LLM that emits **tool calls describing edits**. Each turn:

1. User types a request and clicks Send.
2. Shell asks the LLM with the adapter's tool catalog (plus any shell-injected control tools the adapter declares).
3. For each tool call returned, the adapter normalizes it to a list of op-typed `Edit`s (see [edits-lib](./edits-lib.md)).
4. Shell applies the edits to `adapter.live()` via the edits library, detecting drift per-edit at apply time.
5. Approved changes are committed back through `adapter.commit(newLive)`.
6. The shell auto-continues whenever the round emitted any tool call (program-driven by tool-call presence). A plain-text response with no tool calls ends the iteration and returns control to the user.

The shell does not carry a working copy of the artifact. `adapter.live()` is the single authority, called fresh whenever the shell needs the current value.

**When iteration-studio doesn't fit:** if your surface needs viewport ownership (fullscreen IDE, mobile takeover) or already has a mature standalone UI you want to preserve, use [edits-lib](./edits-lib.md) directly — import `applyEdits` / `inverseEdit` / `showConflictResolution` from `/scripts/lib/edits/index.js` and own the UI yourself. CardApp Studio (`extensions/character-editor-assistant/studio/`) is the in-tree reference.

## Quick start: minimal adapter

```js
import { defineAdapter, openIterationStudio } from '/scripts/iteration-studio/index.js';

const TOOL_SET = 'mything_set_value';

export function createMyThingAdapter({ readValue, writeValue, listMetas, loadMeta, saveMeta, deleteMeta }) {
    return defineAdapter({
        id: 'mything',
        title: 'My Thing Studio',
        mode: 'mything',
        layout: 'popup',
        i18n: (s) => s,
        i18nFormat: (s, ...args) => args.reduce((out, v, i) => out.split('${' + i + '}').join(String(v)), s),

        live: () => readValue(),
        commit: async (newLive) => { await writeValue(newLive); },
        sessionScope: () => 'global',

        listSessions: async () => listMetas(),
        loadSession: async (_scope, id) => loadMeta(id),
        saveSession: async (_scope, session) => saveMeta(session),
        deleteSession: async (_scope, id) => deleteMeta(id),

        buildSystemPrompt: () => 'You edit a single string. Call mything_set_value with the new value.',
        buildUserPrompt: (session, userText) => `[Current]\n${readValue()}\n\n[Request]\n${userText}`,

        buildToolCatalog: () => [{
            type: 'function',
            function: {
                name: TOOL_SET,
                description: 'Set the value.',
                parameters: {
                    type: 'object',
                    properties: { next: { type: 'string' } },
                    required: ['next'],
                    additionalProperties: false,
                },
            },
        }],
        normalizeToolCallToEdit: (call) => {
            if (call?.name !== TOOL_SET) return null;
            const next = String(call?.args?.next ?? '');
            return [{ op: 'set', path: '', oldValue: readValue(), newValue: next }];
        },

        renderMessageCard: (message) => `<div>${message.role}: ${message.content}</div>`,
        renderHistoryItem: (meta) => `<div>${meta.title}</div>`,
    });
}

await openIterationStudio(adapter, SillyTavern.getContext(), settings, document.body);
```

That is the entire adapter. The shell handles popup chrome, conversation rendering, history list, auto-continue, abort plumbing, LLM retry / timeout, drift-aware apply, conflict UI, and rollback.

## Authority model

`adapter.live()` is the single source of truth.

- The shell never caches a working profile. Every render and every apply re-reads `live()`.
- `adapter.commit(newLive)` is the only write path. The adapter decides where that goes (extension settings, character state, IndexedDB, remote API).
- Drift detection happens **per-edit at apply time** via the edits library. If the user edits the artifact externally between the LLM proposal and the user clicking Approve, conflicts surface through the standard conflict UI from `edits-lib`.
- Rollback uses `inverseEdit(edit)` over the message's `appliedEdits` array in reverse, then re-commits.

This means the artifact stays editable outside the studio at all times. The studio is one editor among many.

## Tool dispatch

`buildToolCatalog(session)` returns the adapter's editable + custom control tools. The shell does not inject any continue / finalize control tools — the multi-round auto-continue loop is program-driven by tool-call presence (any tool call → next round, plain text + no tool calls → stop). If your adapter needs popup-side control tools (e.g. reset-state affordances), declare them in your catalog and route them through `classifyToolCall` / `executeControlToolCall` like any other adapter-specific control tool.

Each LLM tool call routes through `classifyToolCall(call)` (default: anything not matching the adapter's declared control names is editable). Editable calls go to:

```ts
normalizeToolCallToEdit(call, { session, live }): Edit[] | null | Promise<Edit[] | null>
```

Return the op-typed edits (see [edits-lib](./edits-lib.md) for op shapes). Return `null` to skip the call.

**Sandbox-diff pattern** — quick bootstrap when you already have a working in-place mutator:

1. `clone live` into a sandbox profile.
2. Run the existing mutator against the sandbox.
3. Emit one coarse `{ op: 'set', path: '', oldValue: live, newValue: sandbox }` edit.

The reference adapters use this pattern. It is good enough to ship but produces profile-level conflicts (any concurrent change collides with the whole batch). For production-grade conflict resolution, normalize each tool call into per-field ops (`set` / `str_replace` / `list_insert` etc).

Adapter-declared control tools (reset-state, mode-switch, etc) route through the runner's `isControlCall` predicate to your `onControlCall` handler rather than the normalize-to-edit path. The shell counts them as tool calls for auto-continue purposes — any control-tool emission still triggers the next round.

## Runner settings

The runner has knobs that affect every LLM round-trip — retries, requests-per-minute cap, and streaming transport. Adapters opt in via `getRunnerSettings`:

```ts
getRunnerSettings(settings): RunnerSettings | null
```

`settings` is the same blob you passed to `openIterationStudio`. The return shape:

```ts
type RunnerSettings = {
    toolCallRetryMax?: number;       // default 0 — retries for malformed / missing tool calls
    rpmLimit?: number;               // default 0 — per-iteration-studio shared RPM cap (0 = unbounded)
};
```

Returning `null` / `undefined` / `{}` keeps the defaults. The shell does not read raw fields from your settings blob — this hook is the only path. That lets each adapter expose its own settings UI (CPA surfaces them; CardApp Studio currently exposes neither) without the shell having to know your storage path. Transport selection (SSE vs one-shot POST) is handled by `generateTask` based on the resolved preset's `stream_openai`; adapters do not need to expose a toggle for it.

## Session storage

The adapter owns session persistence. Four hooks:

```ts
listSessions(scope): Promise<SessionMeta[]>           // newest first
loadSession(scope, id): Promise<Session | null>
saveSession(scope, session): Promise<void>
deleteSession(scope, id): Promise<void>
```

`scope` is whatever `sessionScope()` returns. Common patterns: `'global'`, `'character_<avatar>'`, `'chat_<chatId>'`.

Where you store sessions is entirely up to you. Typical patterns:

- Global → an extension-settings bucket: `extension_settings.my_extension.iterStudioSessions`
- Per-character → `context.getCharacterState(avatar, 'my_ext_iter_sessions')`
- Per-chat → chat metadata

Session shape is shell-defined (see `public/scripts/iteration-studio/adapter.js` for the JSDoc typedef). The adapter can stash arbitrary blob data in `session.surfaceState`.

## Layout choice

`layout: 'popup' | 'split'`.

- `'popup'` — single-column conversation. The composer + history are stacked. Use for adapters where the artifact preview is short or the diff already lives inside message cards.
- `'split'` — two-column conversation + preview pane. The right pane is rendered by `renderPreviewPane(state)`. Use when the artifact has a meaningful canonical view (graph schema, profile tree, character card) that the user wants visible alongside the chat.

Slot hooks the shell calls into:

| Hook | When | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `renderMessageCard(message, state)` | Every conversation message | yes |
| `renderHistoryItem(meta)` | Each session in the history list | yes |
| `renderPreviewPane(state)` | Right pane of `split` layout | required for `split` |
| `renderToolbarSlots(state)` | Extra `{start, end}` HTML for the toolbar | optional |
| `handleAction(actionId, ctx)` | Any click / change on `[data-iter-custom-action="<id>"]` inside the popup | optional |

## Preview pane

`renderPreviewPane(state) => string` returns HTML for the right pane in `split` layout. The shell wholesale-replaces the preview pane on every rerender (every chat tick, busy-state toggle, AI tool call, etc.). Good fit: field summaries, tab placeholders, read-only diff lists. Adapters that hold widget state needing to survive rerenders (CodeMirror, charts, etc.) should keep that surface outside the iteration-studio shell — use [edits-lib](./edits-lib.md) directly.

## Reference

Adapters can offer a "Compare with..." selector that pulls a snapshot from elsewhere and renders it next to live. Two hooks:

```ts
listReferences(session): { id: string, label: string }[]
loadReference(id): Promise<any>
```

The shell shows the dropdown in the toolbar, calls `loadReference(id)` when the user picks one, and passes the result through `state.reference` to render hooks. Omit both to hide the selector entirely.

## Custom ops

The shell calls `adapter.registerCustomOps?.(registry)` once per `openIterationStudio()` invocation. The `registry` is a facade that wraps the edits-lib engine's `registerOp` with a `getRegisteredOp` guard, so re-opening the popup never re-registers (or fails on duplicate). Adapters that introduce schema-specific ops register them here.

Example — CEA's lorebook-entry custom ops:

```js
import {
    createLorebookEntryAddOp,
    createLorebookEntryUpdateOp,
    createLorebookEntryRemoveOp,
} from './lorebook-ops.js';

registerCustomOps: (registry) => {
    registry.registerOp('lorebook_entry_add', createLorebookEntryAddOp());
    registry.registerOp('lorebook_entry_update', createLorebookEntryUpdateOp());
    registry.registerOp('lorebook_entry_remove', createLorebookEntryRemoveOp());
},
```

Each handler implements `{ apply, inverse, detectConflict }` — see [edits-lib](./edits-lib.md) for the full op contract. Use a custom op when an entry shape is keyed by something other than array index (e.g. lorebook `uid`s), where built-in `list_*` ops would silently drift across reorderings.

## Migration: clearObsoleteSessions

```ts
clearObsoleteSessions?(scope): Promise<void>
```

A one-shot hook the shell calls once per adapter on first open after upgrade. Use it to wipe legacy v1 storage keys (the shell tracks a per-adapter wipe flag in localStorage so this only runs once). The reference adapters implement it to drop their v1 history buckets:

```js
clearObsoleteSessions: async () => {
    const root = getMySettings();
    if (root && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(root, LEGACY_GLOBAL_HISTORY_KEY)) {
        delete root[LEGACY_GLOBAL_HISTORY_KEY];
        persistSettings();
    }
}
```

If nothing needs migrating, omit the hook.

## Three-layer API exposure

Per the Luker API convention, every shell capability is exposed at three layers — same as `edits-lib`:

```js
// Layer 1 — direct ESM import (in-tree extensions)
import { openIterationStudio, defineAdapter } from '/scripts/iteration-studio/index.js';

// Layer 2 — lukerContext property (CardApp / extension code with a context handle)
const { openIterationStudio, defineAdapter } = lukerContext.iterationStudio;

// Layer 3 — getContext (third-party extensions)
const { open, defineAdapter } = SillyTavern.getContext().iterationStudio;
```

The Layer 3 surface re-exports the same functions as Layer 1; `open` is a short alias for `openIterationStudio`.

## Reference adapters

Read these for working end-to-end examples of the contract:

- `public/scripts/extensions/orchestrator/iteration-adapter.js` — wraps the orchestrator's pre-existing mutator with the sandbox-diff pattern. Layout `split`, per-mode session buckets, runtime world-info resolution, custom control tool names.
- `public/scripts/extensions/memory-graph/schema-adapter.js` — node-type schema editor built directly on the v2 contract. Layout `split`, global-only sessions, apply-to-global / apply-to-character action buttons in the preview pane.
- **CEA Character Editor** — `public/scripts/extensions/character-editor-assistant/character-editor-adapter.js`, layout `split`, per-character session scope `char_<avatar>`. Live shape is `{ card, lorebook: { bookName, entries: { [uid]: entry } } }`. Edits character card fields via `mergeCharacterAttributes` and lorebooks via `context.saveWorldInfo`. Registers custom ops (`lorebook_entry_add / update / remove`) keyed by entry uid.
- **CPA (Completion Preset Assistant)** — `public/scripts/extensions/completion-preset-assistant/cpa-iteration/` (the studio mounts itself as a popup via `openCpaIterationStudio`, separate from the layered `iterationStudio` open / defineAdapter contract). Per-preset session scope `preset_<name>`. The live target is the user's currently-selected OpenAI preset (via `context.presets.get`); `commit()` writes back via `context.presets.save(..., { select: true })`. Tool catalog covers editable preset-edit ops, read-only inspection tools, and Skills authoring tools (inventory + write + verbatim extract, exposed when session mode is `orchestrator-optimize` and pulled directly from the orchestrator's `skill-iter-studio-tools.js` registry). No preview pane — the per-message edit summary in the chat is the diff.

The adapter contract JSDoc lives in `public/scripts/iteration-studio/adapter.js` — that file is the canonical source for required vs optional fields and exact signatures.
