# Logging System

Luker has a built-in comprehensive log capture and management system covering both the backend server and the frontend browser. When you encounter issues that need troubleshooting, the logging system helps you quickly identify the cause.

The logging system is a standalone feature module that does not depend on other Luker features (such as Memory Graph, CardApp, etc.) and requires no additional configuration.

## Backend Logs

Luker's backend logging system automatically intercepts all console output from the server and stores logs in memory for viewing.

### How It Works

- **Auto-interception**: On server startup, Luker automatically intercepts `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, and other outputs
- **Ring buffer**: Logs are stored in a fixed-size memory buffer. When the buffer is full, the oldest logs are automatically discarded, ensuring memory usage stays bounded
- **Timestamps and levels**: Log entries record a precise timestamp and log level, making it easy to filter by time and severity

### Viewing and Management

Both log sources are located in the **User Settings** drawer: open it and select **Logs**. Select **Server** or **Frontend** as the source, filter by start/end time or entry count, search the contents, then copy or clear the buffer. Server logs are visible to administrators, and on installs without user accounts.

Next to it, **Export Debug Logs** downloads a single JSON bundle — frontend logs, performance marks, device and viewport info, server logs, and recent request-inspector entries — which is the most convenient item to attach to a bug report.

::: tip
Backend logs are only kept in memory and are cleared on server restart. If you need persistent log records, it is recommended to redirect Luker's console output to a file.

## Frontend Log Manager

Luker also includes a built-in log manager on the browser side for capturing various runtime information from the frontend.

### Console Interception

The frontend log manager intercepts browser console output — `console.trace`, `console.debug`, `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn`, `console.error` — and writes it to an in-memory buffer (up to 3000 entries).

### Fetch Request Logs

In addition to console output, the frontend log manager automatically records API request information sent by the browser, including:

- Request method and path
- Response status code and latency
- Error messages for failed or aborted requests

This information is processed with **smart summarization** — only key fields are extracted. Full request content is not recorded, balancing debugging value with privacy protection.

### Global Error Capture

The frontend log manager also automatically captures unhandled errors and Promise rejection events in the browser, ensuring these easily overlooked exceptions are also recorded.

### Log Visibility

By default, only `error`-level logs are displayed in the browser console. If you need more detailed debug information, you can enable debug mode, which outputs all log levels to the browser console.

Regardless of whether debug mode is enabled, all log levels are written to the in-memory buffer and can be exported for viewing at any time.

## Use Cases

### Debugging Issues

When Luker exhibits abnormal behavior, the logging system is the most direct troubleshooting tool:

- **API connection failures** — Check error messages in the backend logs to confirm whether the API address and key are correct
- **Generation interruptions** — Check Fetch request records in the frontend logs to understand whether requests timed out or were rejected
- **Extension errors** — Frontend logs capture runtime errors from extensions, helping locate the problematic extension

### Error Reporting

If you need to report an issue to developers, use **Export Debug Logs** in the User Settings drawer — it bundles the log snapshot with the surrounding context, which is considerably more helpful for diagnosis than screenshots alone.

::: warning
Logs may contain partial API request information. When sharing logs, please check whether they contain sensitive content (such as API keys). The frontend log manager already sanitizes sensitive fields, but it is still recommended to review logs before sharing.
