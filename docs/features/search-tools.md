# Search Tools

Search Tools provides AI characters with web search capabilities, allowing characters to retrieve real-time information during conversations and inject search results into the context. The search plugin supports multiple search engine backends and provides working modes to accommodate different use cases.

## Working Modes

```d2
direction: right

TOOL: "Tool mode" {
  T_USER: "User asks"
  T_LLM: "Creative LLM"
  T_DECIDE: "LLM decides:\nsearch needed?" {
    shape: diamond
  }
  T_TOOL: "Calls luker_web_search\n/ luker_web_visit" {
    style.fill: "#e1f5ff"
  }
  T_RESULT: "Result returned as tool-call output\ninjected into context"
  T_FINAL: "LLM produces final reply"

  T_USER -> T_LLM -> T_DECIDE
  T_DECIDE -> T_TOOL: "yes"
  T_TOOL -> T_RESULT
  T_RESULT -> T_LLM
  T_DECIDE -> T_FINAL: "no"
}

AGENT: "Pre-request agent mode" {
  A_USER: "User asks"
  A_AGENT: "Search agent\nindependent LLM preset"
  A_DECIDE: "Analyze conversation:\nsearch needed?" {
    shape: diamond
  }
  A_SEARCH: "Run search\nmulti-round if needed"
  A_WRITE: "Write results to World Info entries" {
    style.fill: "#fff3e0"
  }
  A_LLM: "Creative LLM"
  A_FINAL: "LLM produces final reply\nWorld Info entries injected as references"

  A_USER -> A_AGENT -> A_DECIDE
  A_DECIDE -> A_SEARCH: "yes"
  A_SEARCH -> A_WRITE -> A_LLM -> A_FINAL
  A_DECIDE -> A_LLM: "no"
}
```

### Tool Mode

Search functionality is registered as a callable tool for the creative LLM in the [Function Call Runtime](/improvements/function-call-runtime). When the AI determines it needs to search for information, it proactively initiates a tool call.

- Enabled via the `enabled` configuration option
- Registers `luker_web_search` and `luker_web_visit` as function tools
- AI autonomously decides when to search and what to search for
- Search results are injected into the conversation context as tool call return values

### Pre-request Agent Mode

Before the creative LLM generates a response, an independent search Agent runs automatically. The Agent analyzes the current conversation content, determines whether a search is needed, and writes search results into World Info entries.

- Enabled via the `preRequestEnabled` configuration option
- The Agent uses independent LLM presets (`agentPresetName`) and API presets (`agentApiPresetName`), which can use different models from the creative LLM
- Agent maximum execution rounds are controlled by `agentMaxRounds`
- Search results are automatically created as World Info entries that the creative LLM can directly read during generation
- Supports stopping Agent execution via the Stop button on toast notifications

::: tip Choosing Between Modes
**Tool Mode** is suitable for scenarios where the model needs to autonomously decide when to search during conversation — for example, when a user asks "What's in the news lately?" the model will automatically call the search tool to get information. Search behavior is autonomously triggered by the model based on conversation content.

**Pre-request Agent Mode** automatically executes searches before an AI generation, with the search process completely separated from the main conversation. Suitable for scenarios where you want responses backed by the latest information.

## Settings Panel

All search plugin configuration lives under the "Search Tools" subsection of the extensions panel:

![Search Tools settings panel](/images/search-tools/search-tools-settings.png)

The top toggles map to the modes above ("Expose tools to main model" = Tool Mode, "Run search agent before requests" = Pre-request Agent Mode); they can be enabled independently or together. Below them are engine selection, agent-only presets, and World Info entry injection parameters.

## Supported Search Engines

| Search Engine | Description | Configuration Requirements |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **DuckDuckGo** | Default search engine, no API key required | Works out of the box |
| **SearXNG** | Self-hosted meta search engine, privacy-friendly | Requires self-hosted instance URL |
| **Brave Search** | Search API provided by Brave | Requires API key |

The search engine is selected via the `provider` configuration option, with each engine's independent configuration stored in `providerSettings`. You can also configure the safe search level via `safeSearch`.

## World Info Entry Management

In Pre-request Agent Mode, search results are automatically created as World Info entries. The behavior of these entries can be controlled through the following configuration options:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lorebookDepth` | Injection depth of entries in the prompt |
| `lorebookRole` | Role marker for entries (e.g., system, assistant) |
| `lorebookEntryOrder` | Sort weight of entries |
| `lorebookPosition` | Injection position of entries |

Search result entries can be set to `constant` (always active) or activated through keyword matching, depending on the Agent's judgment and configuration.

## Global API

The search plugin provides a global API for integration by other plugins. For example, the [Character Card Editor Assistant](/features/card-editor/)'s [popup](/features/card-editor/popup) and [CardApp Studio](/features/card-editor/studio) both integrate the search capability, enabling web searches for reference materials during card / CardApp editing.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `toolNames` | `Object` | Tool name constants object, containing `SEARCH` and `VISIT` |

### Methods

| Method | Return Value | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `getToolDefs()` | `Array` | Returns the search tool definition array, including tool names, parameter schemas, etc. |
| `isToolName(name)` | `boolean` | Determines whether a given name is a tool name registered by the search plugin |
| `invoke(call, options)` | `Promise` | Invokes a search tool; `call` contains the tool name and parameters |
| `search(args)` | `Promise` | Directly executes a search and returns results |
| `visit(args)` | `Promise` | Directly visits a specified web page and returns page content |
| `getSettings()` | `Object` | Returns a snapshot of current search plugin settings |

### Usage Example

```javascript
const api = Luker.searchTools;
if (api) {
  // Check if it's a search tool
  api.isToolName('luker_web_search'); // true

  // Get tool definitions
  const defs = api.getToolDefs();

  // Directly call search
  const results = await api.search({ query: '...', maxResults: 5 });

  // Visit a web page
  const page = await api.visit({ url: 'https://...', maxChars: 10000 });
}
```

## Result Reuse

The search plugin implements a fine-grained result reuse mechanism to avoid redundant searches in unnecessary scenarios.

The system automatically determines whether the previous search Agent's results can be reused. Reuse requires all of the following conditions to be met:

1. The current chat key matches the previous snapshot's chat key
2. The user anchor (characteristics of the last user message) matches the previous snapshot
3. The current generation type belongs to a reusable type (e.g., regeneration, continue generation scenarios)

When results are reused, the UI displays a `(reused)` marker, indicating that cached search results were used for this generation.

## Impact of Message Operations

The search plugin monitors message deletion and editing events, automatically maintaining internal state consistency:

- **Message deletion** — Updates search state based on the range of deleted messages, ensuring no references to search results from deleted messages
- **Message editing** — Updates search state based on the edited message position, potentially invalidating cached search results
