# Authoring skills

A skill is a directory with one required file (`SKILL.md`) and optional sub-folders. Authoring a skill means picking a name, writing frontmatter, and writing a body the agent can read. That's it.

This page covers the conventions Luker (and Anthropic) expect, the choices you face along the way, and walks through bundled skills as worked examples.

## Ways to write a skill

You don't have to type a SKILL.md by hand. Most users start one of these ways:

| Route | Where | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **Have the LLM write it** | [AI Iteration Studio](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio#authoring-skills-via-iter-studio) | Just tell the Studio what you want in a sentence; it drafts the SKILL.md, installs it, optionally attaches it to an agent. Recommended starting point. |
| **Write it by hand** | [Skill management panel → Create new](/features/skills/management#tab-1-installed) | You already know exactly which sections you want and want full control over wording. |

## Directory layout

```
my-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # required — frontmatter + Markdown body
├── references/       # optional — supplementary checklists, longer specs
├── examples/         # optional — worked examples the agent can pull
├── assets/           # optional — binary attachments (images, PDFs)
└── scripts/          # optional — present for forward-compat; v1 is no-op
```

Only `SKILL.md` is required. The other folders are conventions — Luker doesn't enforce them, but they match Anthropic's layout, so a skill stays portable.

::: info Sub-folders use the same `skill_read` tool
Agents don't get separate tools per sub-folder. They use `skill_read({ name, path })` with the relative path: `skill_read({ name: "my-skill", path: "references/checklist.md" })`. Sub-folders are purely organizational.

## Frontmatter — the Anthropic standard

`SKILL.md` opens with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A one-sentence summary the agent reads in the catalog.
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: Your Name
  version: 1.0.0
  tags: [writing-rules, en]
---

# my-skill-name

Body starts here.
```

| Field | Required | Constraint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `_`; ≤128 chars | Must match the directory name. The orchestrator references this from `skills.visible`. |
| `description` | yes | one sentence | Shown in the auto-injected `<available_skills>` catalog. Write it for the **agent**, not the user — explain when this skill is relevant. |
| `license` | no | any string (free-form) | Anthropic-standard. Use if you're sharing outside your own setup. |
| `metadata.author` | no | string | Anthropic-standard. |
| `metadata.version` | no | semver-ish string | Anthropic-standard. Bump when you change semantics. |
| `metadata.tags` | no | array of strings | Searchable hint. |

## Authoring the body

The body is the contract. When an agent calls `skill_read({ name })`, the body is what it sees (plus the frontmatter as a small JSON-ish header). Treat the body as a directive document, not a reference encyclopedia.

A pattern that works well — borrowed from the bundled skills — has these sections:

1. **What this skill is for** — one paragraph the agent reads to confirm it picked the right skill.
2. **Core rules / method** — the actual contract. Numbered lists, tables, checklists. Be specific and concrete; the agent will follow the wording.
3. **Examples or worked failures** — show what success and failure look like. The bundled `director-anti-cliche-zh` uses `✗ wrong` / `✓ right` line pairs.
4. **When to read which sub-file** — if you ship `references/`, tell the agent when each sub-file is worth reading.

### Tone — write for the agent

Skills are read by an LLM, not by a human ops manual reader. Implications:

- **Be directive, not descriptive.** "Avoid X" beats "X is generally considered undesirable." The bundled skills are written in this voice.
- **Avoid meta-justification.** A skill body that opens with "This is a great skill that will help you because…" is wasted tokens. The agent already decided to read it; tell it what to do.

### Length and limits

Hard limits (server-enforced):

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` size | 512 KB |
| Single file in skill | 4 MB |
| Total skill size | 16 MB |
| File count per skill | 100 |

Most bundled skills are 2–8 KB of Markdown. If your skill is approaching 100 KB, consider splitting it: put a 5–15 KB directive body in `SKILL.md` and move long checklists into `references/<topic>.md`. The agent can selectively `skill_read({ name, path: "references/..." })` only when relevant — cheaper context, faster reads.

### Reading budget

`skill_read` enforces a hard ceiling of 50 KB per response. Larger files come back with `truncated: true`; the agent calls `skill_read` again with `offset` to continue. Author your skill body so the most-important content is up top — the agent that reads only the first 50 KB still gets the contract.

## When to use sub-files

Sub-files (`references/`, `examples/`, `assets/`) earn their keep when:

- **They're consulted only sometimes.** A general checklist that's needed every dispatch belongs in `SKILL.md`. A specialized fallback consulted in 5% of cases belongs in `references/`.
- **They're long.** A 30 KB worked example pollutes the SKILL.md read; put it in `examples/`.
- **They're binary.** Images, fonts, PDFs go in `assets/`. (Binary files in skills work but the agent can't read them through `skill_read`. Use them as URL-linked assets if the deployment surfaces them.)

In `SKILL.md`, point the agent at the sub-files explicitly:

```markdown
## When to read additional files

- `references/cliche-deep-list.md` — extended list of banned phrasings beyond the
  top-20 in this file. Read when the draft repeatedly trips a pattern that's not
  named here.
- `examples/before-after.md` — paired examples of "data-person prose" vs
  rewritten human prose. Read once at the start of the session for calibration.
```

## Worked example 1: `director-anti-cliche-zh`

This bundled skill is a single ~3 KB SKILL.md with no sub-files. It enforces anti-cliché writing rules across the entire default director profile.

The frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: director-anti-cliche-zh
description: Anti-cliche patterns for narrative writing — banned phrasings, AI-自造 labels, contract-vocab, sublimation cliches.
metadata:
  author: Luker Team
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

The body follows a "rule families" structure: each major cliché family (data-person prose, contract vocabulary, sublimation clichés, AI-coined labels) gets its own heading with concrete bilingual examples. There are no sub-files — the entire contract is small enough to live in `SKILL.md`.

This skill is mode-level visible: every default director sub-agent (main agent, voice critic, continuity critic, plot brainstormer, …) sees it. It anchors the team's writing standard.

## Worked example 2: `event-summary-rules-zh`

This bundled skill is a denser ~12 KB SKILL.md, also with no sub-files. It's the writing contract for the `memory_curator` sub-agent — the V10 event-summary discipline.

The frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: event-summary-rules-zh
description: Event summary writing rules (V10) for memory_curator — 7-step process, gate loop, anti-paraphrase discipline.
metadata:
  author: Luker Team
  version: 1.0.0
---
```

The body opens by establishing a mental model ("index, not replay"), then defines a 7-step writing process with a gate loop, then enumerates the anti-paraphrase rules in detail. Crucially, it includes worked examples for every rule — both ✗ wrong and ✓ right side by side — because the discipline is subtle and an LLM with only abstract rules consistently violates them.

This skill is per-sub-agent: only `memory_curator` has it in its `skills.visible` list (via `"+"` inheritance from the mode-level defaults). The voice critic doesn't need it; the continuity critic doesn't need it; only the curator does, and only when it's actively writing a summary.

## Picking the right scope

When you create a new skill, you pick a scope. Heuristics:

- **`global`** — Default for personal use. Universal rules you'd want on every chat.
- **`preset`** — Use when the skill only makes sense paired with a specific Chat Completion preset (a model-tuned prompt convention, a sampler-dependent style rule). The skill rides with the preset on export.
- **`character`** — Use when the skill encodes card-specific lore or voice rules. The skill rides with the character card on export (PNG metadata).

You can change scope later — the skill manager subpanel has a **Move to…** action that does an atomic move. References in orchestrator profiles (which use **name only**, no scope prefix) stay stable across the move.

## Validation and safety

The server validates a skill at install / write time:

- Frontmatter must parse as YAML.
- `name` must match the directory name.
- File paths inside the skill must not escape the skill directory (no `..`, no absolute paths).
- Size limits (above) are enforced fail-fast.
- `scripts/` is parsed but never executed — present for forward-compat. The UI shows a risk badge when a skill ships scripts.

If validation fails, the install or write rolls back atomically (writes go through a `.staging/` directory and only commit after validation passes).
