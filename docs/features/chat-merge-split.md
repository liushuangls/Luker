# Chat Merge and Split

Combine several chats into one in the order you pick, with per-source range
trimming. Or cut one chat into multiple new chats at the points you choose.

## Merging chats

1. Open **Past Chats** (the chat-list popup for the current character or
   group), then click the merge icon in the popup header.

2. Click **+ Add chat** to pick a source chat. Add as many as you want. The
   same chat can be added more than once.

3. **Drag the ⋮⋮ handle** on the left of each row to reorder. Any row can
   move to any position.

4. **Set the `from` / `to` numbers** to include only a slice of the source.
   The colored bar shows which messages are included. Click **Use all** to
   reset a row to the full chat.

5. Type a **target name** at the top and click **Merge**. The new chat opens
   automatically.

## Splitting a chat

1. Find the message where you want the chat to split. Click the
   ✂ **Split Chat** icon in that message's button bar.
2. The dialog opens with one split point pre-filled at that message's index.
   Click **+ Add point** for more split points; type into the numeric inputs
   to fine-tune.

3. Rename each segment if you want, then click **Split**. The new chats are
   created in your chat list; the source chat is left untouched.

## Group chats

Merge works the same way for group chats. Open Past Chats from a group and
follow the merge flow above.

The merged group chat is registered with the group automatically, so it
appears in the group's Past Chats list and opens like any other group chat.

## Notes

- The new chats contain only messages. **Plugin state — memory graph,
  orchestrator, search tools, and similar per-chat state — does not
  migrate.** You will need to regenerate it in the new chat.
- Source chats are never modified or deleted.
- If the target name is already in use, ` (2)`, ` (3)`, ... is appended
  automatically.
- Works the same way in single-character chats and group chats. Same-source
  only: you cannot merge a character chat with a group chat.
