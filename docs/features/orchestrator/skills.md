# Skills

When the orchestrator dispatches an agent, that agent only sees the skills you've made visible to it — not the whole skill library. This page is about **making a skill visible to an agent**, from the orchestrator panel.

For what a skill actually is and how to write one, see [the Skills overview](/features/skills/).

## Ways to attach a skill

**Have the Studio attach it for you (recommended).** When you ask the AI Iteration Studio to author or edit a skill, tell it where you want the skill applied — "so every agent in director mode sees it", "only for voice_critic", etc. — and it'll wire the skill into the right place during the same approval round. You don't have to think about layering. See the [recipe](/recipes/rp-skills-walkthrough) and the [Studio docs](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio#authoring-skills-via-iter-studio).

**Attach it yourself.** Open the director editor in the orchestrator panel and scroll down to the skill list section. Each agent has its own list, plus a shared list at the top that every agent inherits from. Pick a skill from the dropdown, click **Add**, save.

If you're unsure which list to use, the Studio is the easier path — just describe what you want and let it decide.

## What the agent sees at dispatch time

The runtime prepends a short catalog to the agent's system prompt — names + descriptions, no bodies:

```
<available_skills>
- director-character-voice-zh: Character voice consistency rules — living-being principle, archetype handling, voice-register matching.
- director-no-meta-zh: 禁止破坏沉浸——叙述与对话都在故事世界内，作者侧装置不在场。
- director-anti-cliche-zh: Anti-cliché checklist — banned phrases, narrative-template avoidance, freshness rules.
- voice-critic-method-zh: How voice_critic audits a draft — pass criteria, common failure modes, hand-off back to the main agent.

(Use skill_read to consult specific content; skill_search to grep within a skill.)
</available_skills>
```

The agent decides what's relevant. If one description sounds load-bearing for the current task, the agent calls `skill_read({name: "..."})` and the SKILL.md body comes back as a tool result.

The catalog only lists names. When `skill_read` is actually called, the runtime walks `character → preset → global` to find the body — character scope wins over preset, preset over global. So a character-scoped skill of the same name silently overrides a global one while that card is loaded.
