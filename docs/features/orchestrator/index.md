# Multi-Agent Orchestration

A carefully prepared scene — a tense standoff, a delicate political negotiation, a slow-burn romance — can still be spoiled by the reply: it skips your last beat, forgets a rule you established two scenes ago, breaks character to summarize, or rushes to a resolution you did not want. This is not because the model is weak; it is because a single pass can only focus on one thing at a time, while you are asking it to handle several at once: stay in character, recall context, respect world rules, plan the next beat, *and* write good prose.

The Orchestrator solves this by running a team of agents before the main reply: extracting the important state from the recent chat, determining which world rules currently apply, planning what the turn should accomplish, reviewing the plan, and packaging the result into a short briefing. By the time the main model writes its reply, it has received that briefing (and only that briefing), so its budget can go to the prose rather than to bookkeeping.

**The orchestrator ships with a working default Spec workflow, so no design work is required to begin. Enable it and it runs.** When a different shape is needed later, every execution mode has its own dedicated editor.

::: info When does it run?
The Orchestrator triggers on the `normal`, `continue`, `regenerate`, `swipe`, and `impersonate` generation types. It runs **after** World Info parsing and **before** the main reply. The Run Panel is kept in memory only — it's cleared when you switch chats.

## 5-Minute Walkthrough (using the default workflow)

No mode selection or workflow authoring is required first — the default Spec is already configured. This section only enables it so its behavior can be observed.

### Step 0 — Prerequisites {#step-0}

- Your main chat already replies normally with a Chat Completion API.
- The current chat has several turns of dialogue (so there's something for the workflow to plan against).

### Step 1 — Enable Orchestrator {#step-1}

Open the Extensions drawer (top bar) and find the **Multi-Agent Orchestration** section. Toggle **Enable** on.

![Orchestrator enable toggle](/images/orchestrator/orch-toggle.png)

### Step 2 — Pick a model for the agents {#step-2}

Scroll within the same panel to **LLM Node API Preset** and **AI Generation API Preset**. These tell the orchestrator agents which API and which Chat Completion preset to use.

::: tip Save money here
The orchestrator calls the LLM once per node. If the main chat uses an expensive model such as Claude Opus, point the orchestrator at a cheaper one — Haiku or Gemini Flash — to cut the cost substantially. If higher quality is needed, route different nodes to different models (each node has its own API/preset override).
:::

### Step 3 — Just send a message {#step-3}

Send a message in the chat — no other settings are needed. Before the main model replies, the default Spec workflow runs in the background. The first run is slower than usual (the agents run in sequence); subsequent runs are faster.

### Step 4 — See what it did for you {#step-4}

As soon as a run starts, the **Run Panel** slides in beside the chat (or rises from the bottom on narrow screens). It updates in real time: rounds are collapsible cards; expand one to see what the model thought, which tools it called, and what they returned.

![The Run Panel as a director run begins](/_screenshots/run-panel/01-panel-initial.png)

As the model streams output, the panel updates in place — no flicker, no chat reflow:

![Streaming progress: reasoning, text, and tool sections fill in real time](/_screenshots/run-panel/02-panel-streaming.png)

Expand any tool call to see its inputs and outputs:

![A tool call expanded — arguments and results](/_screenshots/run-panel/03-panel-tool-expanded.png)

On narrow screens, the panel becomes a bottom drawer you can drag up or dismiss:

![Run Panel on a phone-sized viewport](/_screenshots/run-panel/05-panel-drawer.png)

The panel is kept in memory only. Switching chats or refreshing clears it; the chat thread keeps only the final reply, preserved verbatim. The following actions are also available:

- **Stop** the run while it is in progress
- **Copy** the raw content of any section
- **Export** the full run as JSON (useful for bug reports)
- **Collapse all** to fold every card at once

This is what "the AI thinks before replying" means in practice. If the reply is poor, open the panel and locate exactly where the problem entered.

The orchestrator is now active. From here, pick a direction depending on what is needed:

- The default Spec is not sufficient and needs customization (manual or AI-assisted) → [Spec mode](/features/orchestrator/spec)
- The flow must adapt to the situation and cannot be pre-written as a DAG → [Agenda mode](/features/orchestrator/agenda)
- A single agent should call tools (memory, lorebook, …) until it declares completion → [Loop mode](/features/orchestrator/loop)

::: tip Whichever mode you pick, customization starts here
**[AI Iteration Studio](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio)** is the orchestrator's primary customization tool — describe the goal in one sentence, the AI returns a proposal, and each change is approved individually. Spec, Agenda, Loop and Director all share it, and **it is usually preferable to manual editing**.
:::

## Pick your execution mode

| Mode | What it is | When to use | Skills | Detailed docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec** (default) | A fixed Stage → Node DAG | Default. You want a predictable pipeline | Catalog injected per node; per-node `skills.visible` overrides | [Spec mode](/features/orchestrator/spec) |
| **Single Agent** | A Spec with exactly one node | Low cost, high speed. No multi-agent coordination needed | Catalog injected on the single node | [Single Agent mode](/features/orchestrator/single) |
| **Agenda** | A Planner agent dispatches other agents via tool calls | Flow needs to decide who runs based on what's happening, like an agent loop | Catalog injected on planner + each dispatched worker | [Agenda mode](/features/orchestrator/agenda) |
| **Loop** | One agent calls tools in a single conversation until `finalize` | Balances speed and quality; exploratory research, dynamic decisions | Catalog injected on the loop agent | [Loop mode](/features/orchestrator/loop) |
| **Director** | A main agent + sub-agent team explores the context and drafts the message body | Takeover mode for high-quality long-form RP; ships with bundled skills pre-bound | Catalog injected on the main agent and sub-agent dispatches | [Director mode](/features/orchestrator/director) |

Switch modes from the **Execution mode** dropdown in the extension drawer. Spec and Agenda can convert into each other from the editor (best-effort); Loop has a different structure, for which no analogous conversion exists.

::: tip Want to customize? Start with the Studio
After switching to any mode, the [**AI Iteration Studio**](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio) is the first stop. Spec and Agenda present diffs for approval; Loop patches the profile directly. Both use the same panel and workflow.
:::

::: info Skills column
All modes use the same skills policy shape (`skills.visible` / `skills.deny` at the mode level, optional `+`-inheritance overrides per agent). For the full model, see [Orchestrator integration](/features/skills/orchestrator-integration). Director is the only mode with pre-bound default skills in its bundled profile; other modes start with `visible: ["*"]` (every installed skill is visible).
:::

## Common configuration

These settings are shared across modes.

### Result injection

The orchestrator's final output (the "capsule") is injected into the prompt sent to the main model.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Injection Position | `atDepth` | Where in the prompt to insert the capsule |
| Injection Depth | `0` | Depth at the chosen position |
| Injection Role | `SYSTEM` | One of `SYSTEM` / `USER` / `ASSISTANT` |
| Custom Instruction Prefix | (a default sentence) | Prepended to the capsule text |

The capsule is bound to the user-message floor that triggered orchestration. When you swipe on the same floor, the orchestrator reuses the existing capsule instead of re-running. When you change the configuration, the system reapplies the latest result.

### Character card binding

Orchestration configurations can be bound to a character card. When bound:

- The configuration exports with the card. Anyone importing the card gets the recommended workflow automatically.
- Card creators can ship a workflow that's tuned for their character.
- Switching to the card auto-applies its workflow.
- The card can specify its own execution mode: Spec, Agenda, Loop, or Director.
- Selecting a preset in the card's dropdown switches that chat to it immediately; the card library is preserved either way.
- "Clear presets from this card" reverts to the global configuration.
- You can layer personal tweaks on top of a card-bound configuration.

Card presets work in every mode.

### Import / Export

Spec and Agenda configurations export as JSON.

| Format | Identifier | For |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | `luker_orchestrator_profile_v1` | Spec mode |
| V2 | `luker_orchestrator_profile_v2` | Agenda mode |

Filenames look like `luker-orchestrator-[agenda-][global|character-{name}].json`. The exporter handles both global and per-card scope.

On import, the file's mode (Spec/Agenda) must match your current execution mode. You choose whether to apply to the global config or to a specific card.

::: info Loop import/export
Loop mode does not yet provide file-level Profile import/export buttons. Use the [AI Iteration Studio](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio) to reuse loop workflows.

## Events and Plugin Integration

<details>
<summary>For other extensions and scripts</summary>

The Orchestrator dispatches a frontend event after a run, so other code can consume orchestration results without scraping the UI.

- **Event:** `luker.orchestrator.result`
- **Channel:** `getContext().eventSource`
- **When:** on `completed`, `reused`, `cancelled`, `failed`

Payload:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `module` | string | Always `orchestrator` |
| `event` | string | Always `luker.orchestrator.result` |
| `status` | string | `completed` / `reused` / `cancelled` / `failed` |
| `generationType` | string | The triggering generation type |
| `chatKey` | string | Current chat key |
| `at` | string | ISO timestamp |
| `anchorPlayableFloor` | number | Bound user turn floor (0 if unavailable) |
| `anchorHash` | string | Anchor hash for validation |
| `capsuleText` | string | Final injected guidance text |
| `stageOutputs` | array | Compact stage outputs (`completed` / `reused`) |
| `reviewRerunCount` | number | Review rerun count |
| `reason` | string | Machine-readable reason for cancellation/failure |
| `note` | string | Human-readable note |
| `error` | string | Error message when `failed` |

Subscriber example:

```js
const context = getContext();
context.eventSource.on('luker.orchestrator.result', (evt) => {
    if (evt.status === 'completed' || evt.status === 'reused') {
        console.log('Orchestrator capsule:', evt.capsuleText);
    }
});
```
