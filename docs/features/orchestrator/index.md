# Multi-Agent Orchestration

Have you ever had the AI just... not get it? You set up a careful scene — a tense standoff, a delicate political negotiation, a slow-burn romance — and the reply skips past your last beat, forgets a rule you established two scenes ago, breaks character to summarize, or rushes to a resolution you didn't want. This isn't because the model is dumb. It's because the model can only think about one thing at a time, and you've asked it to do too many in one shot: stay in character, recall context, respect world rules, plan a next beat, *and* write good prose.

The Orchestrator solves this by sending in a small team before the main reply. One agent extracts the important state from your recent chat. Another checks what world rules apply right now. A third drafts a plan for what this turn should accomplish. A fourth reviews their work. A final agent packages everything the team came up with into a single short briefing. By the time the main model writes its reply, it has been handed that briefing (and only that briefing), so it can spend its budget on the prose, not on bookkeeping.

**The orchestrator ships with a working default Spec workflow — you don't have to design anything. Toggle it on and it just runs.** When you want a different shape later, every execution mode has its own dedicated editor.

::: info When does it run?
The Orchestrator triggers on five generation types: `normal`, `continue`, `regenerate`, `swipe`, and `impersonate`. It runs **after** World Info parsing and **before** the main reply. The Run Panel is kept in memory only — it's cleared when you switch chats.

## 5-Minute Walkthrough (using the default workflow)

You don't pick a mode first. You don't write a workflow first. The default Spec is already running. This section just gets it turned on so you can see what it actually does for you.

### Step 0 — Prerequisites {#step-0}

- Your main chat already replies normally with a Chat Completion API.
- The current chat has at least 3 turns of dialogue (so there's something for the workflow to plan against).

### Step 1 — Enable Orchestrator {#step-1}

Open the Extensions drawer (top bar) and find the **Multi-Agent Orchestration** section. Toggle **Enable** on.

![Orchestrator enable toggle](/images/orchestrator/orch-toggle.png)

### Step 2 — Pick a model for the agents {#step-2}

Scroll within the same panel to **LLM Node API Preset** and **AI Generation API Preset**. These tell the orchestrator agents which API and which Chat Completion preset to use.

::: tip Save money here
The orchestrator can call the LLM 5–10 times per turn (one per node). If your main chat uses an expensive model like Claude Opus, point the orchestrator at something cheaper — Haiku, Gemini Flash — and you'll cut 70%+ of the cost. If you need higher quality, route different nodes to different models (each node has its own API/preset override).
:::

### Step 3 — Just send a message {#step-3}

Send a message in the chat — no other settings to touch. Before the main model replies, the default Spec workflow runs in the background. The first time will be slower than usual (running 5–10 agents in sequence); after that it settles in.

### Step 4 — See what it did for you {#step-4}

The moment a run starts, the **Run Panel** slides in beside the chat (or rises from the bottom on narrow screens). It's live: each round is a collapsible card; expand one to see what the model thought, which tools it called, and what they returned.

![The Run Panel as a director run begins](/_screenshots/run-panel/01-panel-initial.png)

As the model streams output, the panel updates in place — no flicker, no chat reflow:

![Streaming progress: reasoning, text, and tool sections fill in real time](/_screenshots/run-panel/02-panel-streaming.png)

Expand any tool call to see its inputs and outputs:

![A tool call expanded — arguments and results](/_screenshots/run-panel/03-panel-tool-expanded.png)

On narrow screens, the panel becomes a bottom drawer you can drag up or dismiss:

![Run Panel on a phone-sized viewport](/_screenshots/run-panel/05-panel-drawer.png)

The panel is in-memory only. Switching chats or refreshing clears it; the chat thread keeps only the final reply, preserved verbatim. You can also:

- **Stop** the run mid-flight
- **Copy** the raw content of any section
- **Export** the full run as JSON (handy for bug reports)
- **Collapse all** to fold every card at once

This is the physical meaning of "the AI thinks before replying." If the reply is bad, open the panel and find exactly where the bad signal came in.

You're using the orchestrator now. From here, three branches based on what you want:

- The default Spec isn't enough — customize it (yourself or with AI help) → [Spec mode](/features/orchestrator/spec)
- Need the flow to change based on situation, can't pre-write a DAG → [Agenda mode](/features/orchestrator/agenda)
- Want a single agent that calls tools (memory, lorebook…) until it says "I'm done" → [Loop mode](/features/orchestrator/loop)

::: tip Whichever mode you pick, customization starts here
**[AI Iteration Studio](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio)** is the orchestrator's primary customization tool — describe what you want in one sentence, the AI returns a proposal, you approve change-by-change. All three modes share it, and **it beats hand-editing in 99% of cases**.
:::

## Pick your execution mode

| Mode | What it is | When to use | Skills | Detailed docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec** (default) | A fixed Stage → Node DAG | Default. You want a predictable pipeline | Catalog injected per node; per-node `skills.visible` overrides | [Spec mode](/features/orchestrator/spec) |
| **Single Agent** | A Spec with exactly one node | Cheap and fast. No multi-agent coordination needed | Catalog injected on the single node | [Single Agent mode](/features/orchestrator/single) |
| **Agenda** | A Planner agent dispatches other agents via tool calls | Flow needs to decide who runs based on what's happening, like an agent loop | Catalog injected on planner + each dispatched worker | [Agenda mode](/features/orchestrator/agenda) |
| **Loop** | One agent calls tools in a single conversation until `finalize` | Strikes the speed/quality balance; exploratory research, dynamic decisions | Catalog injected on the loop agent | [Loop mode](/features/orchestrator/loop) |
| **Director** | A main agent + sub-agent team writes the message body directly | Takeover mode for high-quality long-form RP; ships with 24 bundled skills pre-bound | Catalog injected on main agent + each sub-agent dispatch | [Director mode](/features/orchestrator/director) |

Switch modes from the **Execution mode** dropdown in the extension drawer. Spec and Agenda can convert into each other from the editor (best-effort); Loop has a different shape, no analogous conversion.

::: tip Want to customize? Start with the Studio
After switching to any mode, the [**AI Iteration Studio**](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio) is the first stop. Spec and Agenda surface diffs you approve; Loop patches the profile directly. Same panel, same workflow.
:::

::: info Skills column
All five modes use the same skills policy shape (`skills.visible` / `skills.deny` at the mode level, optional `+`-inheritance overrides per agent). For the full model, see [Orchestrator integration](/features/skills/orchestrator-integration). Director is the only mode that ships with pre-bound default skills out of the box; other modes start with `visible: ["*"]` (every installed skill is visible).

## Common configuration

These settings are shared across modes.

### Result injection

The orchestrator's final output (the "capsule") is injected into the prompt sent to the main model.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Injection Position | `atDepth` | Where in the prompt to insert the capsule |
| Injection Depth | `0` | Depth at the chosen position |
| Injection Role | `SYSTEM` | One of `SYSTEM` / `USER` / `ASSISTANT` |
| Custom Instruction Prefix | (a default sentence) | Prepended to the capsule text |

The capsule is bound to the user-message floor that triggered orchestration. When you swipe on the same floor, the orchestrator reuses the existing capsule instead of re-running. When you change the configuration, the system reapplies the latest result.

### Character card binding

Orchestration configurations can be bound to a character card. When bound:

- The configuration exports with the card. Anyone importing the card gets the recommended workflow automatically.
- Card creators can ship a workflow that's tuned for their character.
- Switching to the card auto-applies its workflow.
- The card can specify its own execution mode (all four modes are supported).
- Selecting a preset in the card's dropdown switches that chat to it immediately; the card library is preserved either way.
- "Clear presets from this card" reverts to the global configuration.
- You can layer personal tweaks on top of a card-bound configuration.

All four modes now support card presets.

### Import / Export

Spec and Agenda configurations export as JSON.

| Format | Identifier | For |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | `luker_orchestrator_profile_v1` | Spec mode |
| V2 | `luker_orchestrator_profile_v2` | Agenda mode |

Filenames look like `luker-orchestrator-[agenda-][global|character-{name}].json`. The exporter handles both global and per-card scope.

On import, the file's mode (Spec/Agenda) must match your current execution mode. You choose whether to apply to the global config or to a specific card.

::: info Loop import/export
Loop mode doesn't have file-level Profile import/export buttons yet. Use the [AI Iteration Studio](/features/orchestrator/iteration-studio) to reuse loop workflows.

## Events and Plugin Integration

<details>
<summary>For other extensions and scripts</summary>

The Orchestrator dispatches a frontend event after each run, so other code can consume orchestration results without scraping the UI.

- **Event:** `luker.orchestrator.result`
- **Channel:** `getContext().eventSource`
- **When:** on `completed`, `reused`, `cancelled`, `failed`

Payload:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `module` | string | Always `orchestrator` |
| `event` | string | Always `luker.orchestrator.result` |
| `status` | string | `completed` / `reused` / `cancelled` / `failed` |
| `generationType` | string | The triggering generation type |
| `chatKey` | string | Current chat key |
| `at` | string | ISO timestamp |
| `anchorPlayableFloor` | number | Bound user turn floor (0 if unavailable) |
| `anchorHash` | string | Anchor hash for validation |
| `capsuleText` | string | Final injected guidance text |
| `stageOutputs` | array | Compact stage outputs (`completed` / `reused`) |
| `reviewRerunCount` | number | Review rerun count |
| `reason` | string | Machine-readable reason for cancellation/failure |
| `note` | string | Human-readable note |
| `error` | string | Error message when `failed` |

Subscriber example:

```js
const context = getContext();
context.eventSource.on('luker.orchestrator.result', (evt) => {
    if (evt.status === 'completed' || evt.status === 'reused') {
        console.log('Orchestrator capsule:', evt.capsuleText);
    }
});
```
