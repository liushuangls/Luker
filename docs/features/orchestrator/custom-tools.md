# Custom Tools

Custom tools let you give orchestrator agents new capabilities — beyond the builtin chat / lorebook / note / memory tools that ship with Luker. Multiple channels are supported, and every orchestration mode (loop / spec / agenda / director) sees them the same way.

## Where custom tools come from

**From other Luker extensions.** Extensions like memory-graph and search-tools register their tools at startup. You don't have to do anything — the tools appear in the orchestration editor under **Custom tools → Extension (from other plugins)**, and they're enabled by default for first-run profiles.

**From SillyTavern.** SillyTavern has a function-tool system that other plugins use. To make those visible to orchestrator agents, open the orchestration editor and click **Bridge SillyTavern tools…** — pick which ones you want, choose a read/write mode per tool, save. They appear under **Custom tools → From SillyTavern**.

**Handwritten in this profile.** For one-off needs the other channels don't cover, you can write a tool inline. Open the orchestration editor's **Custom tools** section and click **Add custom tool**. Tools defined this way travel with the profile — globally if you author them on the global profile, or with the character card if you author them on a character override.

## The Add custom tool dialog

- **Tool name** — `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`; up to 64 characters. Must start with a letter and must not collide with a builtin tool or another tool in the same profile.
- **Display name** — shown in the orchestration editor's tool list. The LLM still sees the technical name above.
- **Description** — what the LLM should know about the tool. Write this for the model, not for yourself.
- **Mode**
  - **read** — no side effects. Always runs during simulation review.
  - **write** — mutates state. Skipped during simulation review unless you provide a simulate body.
- **Parameters (OpenAI JSON Schema)** — the JSON Schema for the arguments the LLM passes in. Validated as JSON on Save.
- **Function body** — async JavaScript. Two parameters are available:
  - `args` — the parsed arguments the LLM sent.
  - `ctx` — the same object SillyTavern hands to extensions (`getContext()` style), augmented with orchestration-specific fields. See [What's on `ctx`](#whats-on-ctx) below for the full surface.

  Whatever you `return` becomes the tool result the LLM sees. Throw to surface a tool error.
- **Simulate body** — optional. Same signature as the function body; used during simulation review for write tools so the simulated run shows the expected return shape without touching real state.

### What's on `ctx`

The `ctx` object inherits everything the standard `getContext()` returns, plus a few orchestration-only fields the runtime mounts.

From SillyTavern (use the same way you'd use `getContext()`):

- `ctx.chat` — the live chat array, latest message last
- `ctx.characters`, `ctx.characterId` — current character card and its index
- `ctx.groups`, `ctx.groupId` — current group and its index, when in a group chat
- `ctx.name1`, `ctx.name2` — `{{user}}` and `{{char}}` resolved to current names
- `ctx.eventSource`, `ctx.eventTypes` — emit / subscribe to runtime events
- `ctx.getExtensionApi(name)` — call into another extension's published API (e.g. `ctx.getExtensionApi('memory-graph')`)
- `ctx.registerOrchestrationTool`, `ctx.bridgeSillyTavernTool`, etc. — same APIs documented in [Orchestrator tools API](/development/extension-api/orchestrator-tools)

Mounted by the orchestrator runtime (only inside an orchestration call):

- `ctx.__lukerRun` — per-run state. Subfields:
    - `ctx.__lukerRun.activatedEntryKeys` is a `Set` of `${world}.${uid}` keys for World Info entries already injected this turn (so your tool can dedup if it surfaces lorebook content).
    - `ctx.__lukerRun.wiFinalizedPayload` is a **mutable reference** to the in-flight `wiFinalizedPayload` object that `script.js` is about to join into the main model's `<world_info>` channel. Push into `wiFinalizedPayload.worldInfoBeforeEntries` / `.worldInfoAfterEntries` / `.worldInfoDepth[i].entries` *during your tool call* and your content lands in the channel for THIS turn, indistinguishable from a naturally-activated entry. Bypasses the WI token budget and does not trigger recursive key scanning. Available in loop / spec / agenda (which run inside the `GENERATION_WORLD_INFO_FINALIZED` frame); **undefined in director** (its main agent runs in the takeover handler, which fires after WI is baked into the prompt). The Layer-1 `lorebook_force_activate` builtin is the supported wrapper around this — prefer it over hand-rolling the push.
    - `ctx.__lukerRun.abortSignal` is the run's cooperative cancellation signal — check `.aborted` periodically in long tools.
- `ctx.__floorStateForNotes` — the floor-state instance the `note_open` / `note_close` tools use. Read it if your tool wants to coexist with the notes system.
- `ctx.__customToolRegistry` — the per-run Layer-3 registry your own tool was compiled into. Most tools never need this; it's exposed for advanced cases (e.g. introspecting other handwritten tools).
- `ctx.__memoryGraphSession` — opened lazily by the first `memory_*` tool call. Available after at least one memory call this run.

Field name conflicts: SillyTavern owns the top-level names; orchestration adds only `__`-prefixed fields, so the namespaces don't collide.

Minimal patterns:

```js
// Read the current character name
return { char: ctx.characters[ctx.characterId]?.name };

// Call another extension's API
const mg = ctx.getExtensionApi('memory-graph');
const session = await mg.openSession(ctx);

// Emit an event other code can subscribe to
ctx.eventSource.emit('my_tool_fired', { args });

// Cooperative cancellation: check the run's abort signal
if (ctx.__lukerRun?.abortSignal?.aborted) {
    throw new Error('aborted');
}
```

### Safety

The function body runs in the page context with the same permissions as any Luker module. It can fetch arbitrary URLs, mutate global state, and read private chat content. **Only paste code from sources you trust.**

When a character card you're importing carries custom tools, Luker shows a review dialog with each tool's name, description, mode, and full body before deciding whether to import them. You can choose **Apply with tools** to import everything, **Apply without tools** to import the card but drop the custom tools, or expand each entry to inspect the body first.

## Enabling and disabling

The orchestration editor's **Custom tools** checkbox panel controls whether each tool is offered to the LLM in this profile. Disabling does not remove the definition; you can flip it back on later.

Sub-agent tool overrides (in spec nodes / agenda agents / director sub-agents) work the same way for custom tools as for builtin tools — a per-node override shadows the profile default.

## Simulation review

Custom tools participate in the simulation pipeline that the [AI Iteration Studio](./iteration-studio.md) uses to test workflows against your real chat without writing anything back. Read tools always dispatch to your real code. Write tools dispatch to the simulate body when you provided one; otherwise they return the standard placeholder `{ ok: true, simulated: true, unvalidated: true }` and the trace marks them as unvalidated.

## Iteration Studio

The AI iterator authors and maintains Layer-3 custom tools directly on the working profile. It has the full read / write / inspect surface plus a sandbox dry-run + discovery tools so it can validate code against the live `ctx` before asking you to approve it.

Read tools (results returned immediately, no review):

- `luker_orch_list_custom_tools` — list profile-owned entries with mode / description / hasSimulate / a one-line parameter-schema summary.
- `luker_orch_get_custom_tool` — read one entry verbatim, including the full body.
- `luker_orch_dry_run_custom_tool` — compile + execute a body in a sandbox with caller-supplied args. Returns `{ok, result, error, logs, durationMs}`; wall-clock cap is 3 seconds; `console.log/warn/error` are captured. Either `name` (run the live profile entry) or `body` (compile inline) is required.
- `luker_ctx_list_keys` / `luker_ctx_describe` — enumerate / walk into the runtime `ctx` surface (the same object SillyTavern/Luker extensions get via `getContext()`). Returns type, function arity, source preview, sub-keys.
- `luker_docs_list` / `luker_docs_read` — list and read authoritative markdown under `docs/` (default-hides zh-CN / zh-TW translations). Useful starting points: `features/orchestrator/custom-tools.md`, `development/extension-api/chat-and-state.md`, `development/extension-api/generation.md`, `development/extension-api/world-info.md`, `development/extension-api/orchestrator-tools.md`.

Write tools (stage a proposal on the iter-studio's ProposalBus; nothing reaches the profile until you approve the card):

- `luker_orch_set_custom_tool` — create or fully overwrite one entry. Body is compile-validated before staging; a syntax error rejects the call immediately with no proposal.
- `luker_orch_patch_custom_tool_body` — find/replace patch on an existing body (default unique-or-fail; `replaceAll: true` opts into multi-match). Patched body is re-validated for syntax. Avoids re-sending long bodies on small tweaks.
- `luker_orch_patch_custom_tool_schema` — replace only the parameters JSON-Schema. Body unchanged.
- `luker_orch_remove_custom_tool` — delete one entry by name. The card shows the body that will be deleted so you can confirm.

When a `set` proposal is accepted, the iter-studio also flips the mode-appropriate enable flag (`tools.custom.<name>` for loop / director, `defaultTools.custom.<name>` for agenda, `spec.defaultTools.custom.<name>` for spec) to `true` so the new tool is immediately offered to the runtime agent.

Layer-2 tools registered by other extensions cannot be authored from the Studio — their definitions live in the registering extension. Only their enable flags are reachable here.
