# Build a CardApp from Scratch

::: tip What this doc solves
The [CardApp Studio](/features/card-editor/studio) page describes Studio's capabilities. This one walks through a real-genre card to show **how to drive Studio end-to-end**: have it design a memory-graph schema, design an orchestrator loop, write the card and a card-specific world book, and finally build a CardApp panel that evolves with the conversation.

By the end you'll see how Studio stacks all these layers onto a single card — without you writing any code or manually opening any editor toggles.
:::

## What you'll get

The final result is a detective-genre card called **"Victorian Case File"**. <code v-pre>{{char}}</code> is a Holmes-style independent consultant in 1888 London. You play a client (or a visiting Scotland Yard inspector) bringing in a case file, and you investigate together.

This single card carries all of these at once:

- **Memory-graph schema derivation** — four domain node types (`suspect` / `clue` / `forensic_site` / `witness`), not the default schema. **This layer is for the LLM's long-term memory** — the AI extracts entities into these types as the conversation goes, so cross-turn recall has structured slices ready to feed back into the prompt.
- **Orchestrator loop pipeline** — every AI reply runs `draft → critique → revise`, and the critique stage is forced to inspect "missed clues / contradicting suspect testimony / violated period constraints" before the revise stage rewrites.
- **Card-bound world book** — "Victorian Case File · London Archive", with Victorian-London context + detective-procedure rules + **a state-injection entry** (containing <code v-pre>{{getvar::case_*}}</code> placeholders + macro instructions teaching the AI to emit <code v-pre>{{setvar}}</code> to advance the case). **Your global world books are untouched.**
- **"Current Case" CardApp panel** — reads chat variables to surface case state: case name / current phase / suspects / clues / forensic sites. **The variables are advanced by the AI emitting `setvar` macros in its replies**; the CardApp reads via `ctx.getVariable` + `JSON.parse` and renders. One chat turn → AI emits `setvar` → panel updates on the next frame.

The whole setup is just 2 rounds of natural-language conversation — Studio proposes, Studio writes the files, Studio binds the fields, Studio creates the world book.

## Prerequisites

- A working Luker instance
- A configured LLM API; a tool-use-strong model (Claude / GPT-5 etc.) is recommended — Studio's tool flow leans on the model being willing to call tools
- The Character Editor Assistant section has "Model request LLM preset" / "Model request API preset" options; that's what Studio uses for its own AI calls

## 1. Create a blank card → open Studio

Open the right-side character panel, click "Create New Character", name it **"Victorian Case File"**. Leave description / first message / world info binding all empty — Studio will fill those.

Then open the Extensions panel → expand "Character Editor Assistant" → click **"&lt;/&gt; CardApp Studio"**:

::: tip Studio works on cards without CardApp too
The Character Editor Assistant routes cards-without-CardApp to the [popup mode](/features/card-editor/popup) and cards-with-CardApp into Studio automatically. But **the CardApp Studio button can pull any card into Studio on demand** — and Studio's tool surface is the full set (memory-graph schema / orchestrator override / regex scripts / world info / character fields), unlike popup mode which only covers fields and world-info entries.
:::

## 2. One genre prompt → Studio proposes the plan

Click into the Studio left-panel input. Describe the genre; let the model figure out how to land it:

```
I want to build a Victorian-London detective-genre character card from scratch.
This card needs:

1. Custom memory-graph schema (derived node types appropriate to the genre — like
   suspect, clue, forensic_site, witness), not the default schema.
2. Orchestrator loop pipeline (draft → critique → revise), configured per your
   best practice.
3. A world book bound to this card (lore + Victorian London context + a few
   detective procedural rules).
4. A simple CardApp that visualizes the "current case" (suspects / clues /
   forensic sites) and updates as the conversation evolves — readers should
   see the panel content change as we chat.

Please land all of this in whatever order you think best. At each step, propose
the plan first; I'll nod, then you write.
```

![Sending the genre prompt](/images/walkthrough/victorian/step-02-first-prompt.png)

After you send, Studio doesn't dive in writing — it lays out the entire plan first.

## 3. Studio proposes the memory-graph schema

It opens with the data layer, deriving the node types this genre needs. Studio proposes four derived types (`suspect` / `clue` / `forensic_site` / `witness`), spelling out the columns each type needs (suspects have `alibi` / `motive` / `suspicion_level`, clues have `found_at` / `linked_suspects`, etc.) and explaining why it's not adding `victim` or `theory` (avoiding schema bloat — let event chains carry the deduction layer instead).

::: tip What "derived types" means
Memory Graph ships with `event` as the core node type (the timeline spine); on top of that you can **define custom node types per card's genre**. The "suspect / clue" concepts a detective card needs are exactly that — derived types — letting the AI store extracted memories in structured form rather than dumping everything into freeform text. See [Memory Graph](/features/memory-graph) for details.
:::

## 4. Studio proposes the orchestrator loop pipeline

Then the generation layer: it recommends `loop` mode — a balance between speed and quality.

## 5. After confirmation, Studio lands everything in one round

Reply something like "all confirmed, go with this plan, don't check back, just build", and Studio launches a batch of tool calls:

![Studio landing all the tool calls](/images/walkthrough/victorian/step-05-tool-calls.png)

In one round it has done:

- **`character_update_memory_graph_schema`** — write the derived node types onto the card (this card only — no global pollution)
- **`character_update_orchestrator`** — write the `draft / critique / revise` loop config onto the card (also character-scoped)
- **`worldinfo_create_chat_book`** + **`worldinfo_replace_entries`** — create the card-specific world book and write all entries in one shot (Victorian-London context, detective procedural rules, **state-injection entry** with <code v-pre>{{getvar::case_*}}</code> placeholders + macro instructions teaching the AI how to emit <code v-pre>{{setvar}}</code>, Scotland Yard culture, Whitechapel district lore, etc.)
- **`character_update_fields`** — write description / personality / first_mes / scenario, and bind the `world` field to the new world book

Each tool call **pops up an approval with a full diff** so you can see what's changing — usually safe to "approve all" in one go.

::: tip The state-injection entry is the variable-driven UI hub
The "state-injection" world book entry contains both <code v-pre>{{getvar::case_*}}</code> (so the AI sees the current case state every time the prompt is assembled) **and macro-teaching <code v-pre>{{setvar}}</code> examples** (instructing the AI when to emit `setvar` in its reply to advance the case). See [Per-Message Variables](/features/variable-op-log) for the mechanics.
:::

::: tip Regex scripts work too
Studio can also write / edit regex scripts (stripping `<thinking>` tags, transforming display formats, etc.) — ask when you need it. This card is simple enough we didn't use any; don't force one if you don't need it.
:::

## 6. (Continuing) Building the live visualization panel

The final prompt:

```
Continue. Now do the last step — the CardApp "current case" visualization panel.
Read chat variables to surface case state: case name / phase / suspects /
clues / forensic sites. Layout per your earlier draft; refresh after each AI
message completes.

Style: Victorian-fog atmosphere (dark parchment paper, serif fonts, dark red /
dark amber accents). Styling / palette / detail decisions are yours. I'll
approve all CardApp file writes.
```

Studio writes the CardApp. It reads chat variables (`case_name` / `case_phase` / `case_suspects` / `case_clues` / `case_sites`).

## 7. End-to-end run

Exit Studio, send a regular RP message. We hand <code v-pre>{{char}}</code> a Whitechapel case file:

> "Detective, someone was murdered in Whitechapel last night, found in their own attic. The victim is Monica Wheeler, 35, a tutor; her husband Henry Wheeler reported it. I just transferred from Scotland Yard with the file and need your read."

### a. The chat reply — every layer kicking in

![End-to-end chat reply](/images/walkthrough/victorian/step-07a-chat-reply.png)

The reply shows all layers cooperating: deductions backed by evidence (specific physical evidence → inference → next investigative step), Victorian class register, period-tech constraints respected (no fingerprint comparison, no telephone calls), and <code v-pre>{{char}}</code>'s own "don't disturb the scene / evidence chain" procedural rules. These come jointly from world-info entries + character fields + the orchestrator capsule.

### b. Inspect what the orchestrator did in the background

Open the **Run Panel** beside the chat (or the bottom drawer on narrow screens) and you can see which steps the loop ran, which tools it called, and how it finalized:

![Orchestrator runtime trace](/images/walkthrough/victorian/step-07b-stage-output.png)

If the loop fails (misconfigured API preset, timeout, etc.), the failure point is marked here and the system automatically falls back to direct generation without the loop — your end-to-end experience stays continuous, you just lose that capsule layer.

### c. Inspect what memory-graph is accumulating long-term

In the Extensions panel → Memory section → "View Graph":

![Memory Graph visualization](/images/walkthrough/victorian/step-07c-memory-graph.png)

The nodes are derived per the schema we just designed (`suspect`, `clue`, `forensic_site`, `witness`, `event`); edges record relationships. **But this is for the LLM** — next time cross-turn recall needs context on Henry Wheeler, the graph automatically feeds the relevant slice into the prompt.

## 8. Watch the CardApp panel evolve with the conversation

Keep chatting. Each turn the AI emits <code v-pre>{{setvar::case_*::...}}</code> macros to advance case state, and the "current case" panel refreshes:

![CardApp panel — after two turns: suspects / clues / forensic sites populating](/images/walkthrough/victorian/step-06b-cardapp-turn2.png)

## Prompting cheatsheet

After a single run-through you'll notice that effective Studio prompts aren't about word count — they're about **clear direction + handing decisions to Studio**:

1. **State the genre and vibe; leave implementation to Studio**
   - ✓ "Victorian London detective card; needs memory-graph schema derivation + loop pipeline + card-specific world book + visualization panel"
   - ✗ "In `character.data.extensions.memory_graph.schema` add an object with `type=suspect` whose fields are `alibi`, `motive`..."

2. **For structural decisions (schema / loop), let Studio propose first**
   - It does this by default (the system prompt bakes the habit in); you just glance at the proposal, push back if you disagree
   - Schema feels overspecified: "drop witness, fold it into suspect" — Studio will redo it
   - Want `agenda` mode instead of loop: "switch to agenda; let the planner decide which thread to chase first" — same deal

3. **Once confirmed, tell it explicitly to stop checking back**
   - Otherwise approving one tool call at a time is slow
   - "Go with this plan, I'll approve all tool calls, just land it"

4. **Ask for explanations when unsure**
   - "Why isn't `victim` in the schema?" — it'll explain ("victim is usually one or two fixed pieces of info — better to put that in `first_mes` or a world-info entry; making it a schema type creates redundancy")
