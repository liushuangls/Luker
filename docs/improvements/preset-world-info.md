# Preset World Info

Preset World Info is an improvement introduced by Luker that allows you to bind specific World Info (Lorebooks) to presets. When switching presets, the associated World Info is automatically activated.

## Use Cases

Different roleplay scenarios often require different preset parameters and world settings. For example:

- **Fantasy scenario**: High temperature + Fantasy World Info (magic systems, race settings, etc.)
- **Modern urban**: Medium temperature + Modern World Info (city landmarks, social rules, etc.)
- **Sci-fi scenario**: Low temperature + Sci-fi World Info (interstellar settings, technology systems, etc.)

With Preset World Info, you can bundle these combinations — when switching presets, the corresponding World Info is automatically activated, eliminating the need for manual switching.

## How to Use

1. In the preset editing interface, find the "Associated World Info" setting
2. Select the World Info to bind with the current preset
3. Save the preset

Afterward, switching to this preset automatically activates the associated World Info. Switching to other presets does not globally auto-deactivate manually enabled World Info.

::: tip
Preset World Info does not affect the World Info that comes with Character Cards. Character Card World Info is always active; preset-associated World Info is additionally layered on top.

## Difference from Manual Activation

World Info has the following activation methods: manual activation and preset-associated activation.

- **Manually activated** World Info remains active at all times, unaffected by preset switching
- **Preset-associated** World Info is auto-activated when that preset is selected

The methods don't interfere with each other. If you want a World Info to be active under all presets, simply activate it manually; if you only want to use it in specific scenarios, preset association is more convenient.

## Integration with Other Features

- **[Card-Bound Presets](/improvements/card-bound-presets)**: Character Cards can recommend presets, and presets can associate World Info, forming a complete chain of "Character Card → Preset → World Info"
- **[Preset Decoupling](/improvements/preset-decoupling)**: Preset World Info is built on the foundation of preset decoupling, with connection configurations and presets managed independently
